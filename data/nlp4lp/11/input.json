We have a total number of \\param{S} schools, \\param{G} student groups, and \\param{N} neighborhoods. Each school s has a capacity for student group g represented by \\param{Capacity}. The population of student group g in neighborhood n is given by \\param{Population}. The distance between neighborhood n and school s is denoted as \\param{Distance}. We may ignore the fact that numbers of students must be integers."
