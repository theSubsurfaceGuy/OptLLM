PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A traveler based in \var{start_city} needs to visit \var{N} towns for business.
- The distance \var{distance_{i,j}} between city \var{i} and \var{j} is provided in miles and are symmetric, meaning the distance from city \var{i} to city \var{j} is the same as from city \var{j} to city \var{i}.
- The traveler must return to \var{start_city} after visiting all towns.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "distances": {
        city_i: {
            city_j: distance_{i, j},
            for j in 1, ..., N-1
        },
        for i in 1, ..., N
    },
    "start_city": start_city
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the shortest route that the traveler can take to visit all \var{N} towns and return to \var{start_city}.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The sequence of cities visited after \var{start_city} is \var{visit_order}.
- \var{total_distance} traveled on this optimal journey.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "visit_order": [city_n for n in 1, ..., N+1],
    "total_distance": total_distance
}
