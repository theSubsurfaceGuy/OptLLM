PROBLEM TYPE: MIP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces \var{P} different parts using \var{M} different machines.
- Batch of 100 part \var{p} requires \var{time_{m,p}} hours on machine \var{m}.
- The division incurs a charge of \var{cost_{m}} per hour for using machine \var{m}.
- Machine \var{m} has an availability of up to \var{available_{m}} hours per month.
- The division sells part \var{p} in batches of 100 at price of \var{price_{p}} per batch.
- Machine \var{1} requires a setup time of \var{setup_time_{p}} hours before it can be used for each part \var{p}.
- Other machines do not require a setup time.
- There are no minimum production quantities for any part.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "time_required": [[time_{m,p} for p in 1, ..., P] for m in 1, ..., M],
    "machine_costs": [cost_{m} for m in 1, ..., M],
    "availability": [available_{m} for m in 1, ..., M],
    "prices": [price_{p} for p in 1, ..., P],
    "setup_time": [setup_time_{p} for p in 1, ..., P]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many batches of each part should the manufacturer produce each month to maximize profit?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the number of batches of each part produced \var{batches_{p}}.
- \var{setup_flags_{p}} indicates whether \var{part_{p}} is set up or not.
- \var{total_profit} represents the total profit obtained for the month.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "batches": [batches_{p} for p in 1, ..., P],
    "setup_flags": [setup_flag_{p} for p in 1, ..., P],
    "total_profit": total_profit
