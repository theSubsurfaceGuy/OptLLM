The buy price of item \\param{i} in month \\param{m} is given by \\param{BuyPrice}. All items can be sold after refining for the same \\param{SellPrice}. Each item is either a vegetable or not, which is indicated by \\param{IsVegetable}. There is a limited refining capability where at most \\param{MaxVegetableRefiningPerMonth} of vegetables and \\param{MaxNonVegetableRefiningPerMonth} of non-vegetables can be refined in any given month. The company has a storage size of \\param{StorageSize} and incurs a \\param{StorageCost} for storing items per month. The refined products must fall within a hardness range of \\param{MinHardness} to \\param{MaxHardness}, where the hardness of item \\param{i} is \\param{Hardness}. Initially, the storage contains an amount of \\param{InitialAmount} of items. What buying, storing, and manufacturing policy should the company pursue in order to maximize profit?",
