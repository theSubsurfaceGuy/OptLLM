The parameters include the number of different products \\param{K} and the number of different machines or stations \\param{S}. Each product k requires \\param{ProduceTime} to produce on station s. Each station s has a total available time of \\param{AvailableTime}. The profit from producing one unit of product k is \\param{Profit}."
