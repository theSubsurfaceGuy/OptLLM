PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- The network faces an intrusion that requires immediate intervention.
- Interventions include isolating nodes or scanning nodes affected by the intruder.
- Each cluster of nodes must be treated with one intervention type consistently.
- Interventions can be processed either centrally or through distributed nodes.
- The processing times for each type of intervention are different across \var{N} clusters.
- The opportunity cost for processing is $\var{central_cost}/h for central and $\var{distributed_cost}/h for distributed processing.
- There is a maximum allotment of \var{max_central} hours for central processing and \var{max_distributed} hours for distributed processing to address the intrusion.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "processing_times": {
        "central": {
            "isolate": [isolate_central_{i} for i in 1, ..., N],
            "scan": [scan_central_{i} for i in 1, ..., N]
        },
        "distributed": {
            "isolate": [isolate_distributed_{i} for i in 1, ..., N],
            "scan": [scan_distributed_{i} for i in 1, ..., N]
        }
    },
    "costs": {
        "central": central_cost,
        "distributed": distributed_cost
    },
    "max_hours": {
        "central_max_hours": max_central,
        "distributed_max_hours": max_distributed
    }
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the most cost-effective combination of interventions to halt the intruder's progress within the network.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The output details the intervention type ('isolate' or 'scan') and processing method ('central' or 'distributed') for each cluster.
- The \var{total_cost} is the sum of costs for all interventions across the clusters.
