PROBLEM TYPE: MILP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A paper company produces large rolls of paper with a width of \var{large_roll_width} inches.
- These large rolls are cut into smaller rolls of various widths options to meet customer demand.
- There are \var{M} different types of smaller rolls.
- The demand for rolls of width \var{inch_j} ​is \var{demand_j}​ units.
- The company has \var{N} different cutting patterns available for producing the smaller rolls.
- For pattern \var{i}, the number of rolls of width \var{j} that are produced is \var{pattern_{i,j}}.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "large_roll_width": large_roll_width,
    "roll_width_options": [inch_j for j in 1, ..., M],
    "demands": [demand_j for j in 1, ..., M],
    "patterns": [[pattern_{i,j} for j in 1, ..., M] for i in 1, ..., N]
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine the minimum number of large \var{large_roll_width}-inch rolls needed to fulfill all the orders.

OUTPUT INFO:

- The different cutting patterns applied to the large rolls are detailed in \var{patterns}.
- The total number of large rolls of paper used in this optimization is \var{total_large_rolls_used}.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "patterns": [
        {
         "pattern": [pattern_j for i in 1, ..., M]
         "amount": amount_i
        }
        for i in 1, ..., N
    ],
    "total_large_rolls_used": total_large_rolls
