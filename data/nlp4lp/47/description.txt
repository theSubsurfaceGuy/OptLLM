PROBLEM TYPE: LP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces \var{P} different parts using \var{M} different machines.
- Batch of 100 part \var{p} requires \var{time_{m,p}} hours on machine \var{m}.
- The division incurs a charge of \var{cost_{m}} per hour for using machine \var{m}.
- Machine \var{m} has an availability of up to \var{available_{m}} hours per month.
- The division sells part \var{p} in batches of 100 at price of \var{price_{p}} per batch.
- The division must produce at least \var{min_batches_{p}} batches of part \var{p} each month to fulfill a contract.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "time_required": [[time_{m,p} for p in 1, ..., P] for m in 1, ..., M],
    "machine_costs": [cost_{m} for m in 1, ..., M],
    "availability": [available_{m} for m in 1, ..., M],
    "prices": [price_{p} for p in 1, ..., P],
    "min_batches": [min_batches_{p} for p in 1, ..., P]
}

OBJECTIVE: How many batches of each part should the manufacturer produce each month to maximize profit?

OUTPUT INFO:

- the number of batches of each part produced \var{batches_{p}}.
- \var{total_profit} represents the total profit obtained for the month.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "batches": [batches_{p} for p in 1, ..., P],
    "total_profit": total_profit
