    "description": "We want to maximize the daily profit of the company, which is the total revenue minus the total cost. The company has \\param{N} different products, each requiring \\param{AssemblyHour} hours for assembly, \\param{TestingHour} hours for testing, and with a material cost of \\param{MaterialCost}. The company cannot exceed \\param{MaxAssembly} hours for assembly and \\param{MaxTesting} hours for testing. Each product can be sold at \\param{Price}, but there is an opportunity to work \\param{MaxOvertimeAssembly} overtime hours for assembly at a cost of \\param{OvertimeAssemblyCost} per hour. Additionally, a material discount of \\param{MaterialDiscount} is offered when a purchase reaches the \\param{DiscountThreshold}."
