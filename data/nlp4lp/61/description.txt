PROBLEM TYPE: MIP

PROBLEM INFO:

- A seaport unloads shipping containers off of rail cars, holds them in its yard on a transport system, and then loads them onto ships.
- The demand \var{demand_{t}} for containers by ships varies every month, and this demand must be fulfilled.
- The unloading cost \var{unload_cost_{t}} per container indicates how much it costs to unload a single container from the rail car.
- The unloading capacity \var{unload_capacity_{t}} specifies the maximum number of containers that can be unloaded in a month.
- For each container kept in the yard until the subsequent month, there is a holding cost of $\var{holding_cost}.
- Due to space limitations, the yard can store a maximum of \var{max_container} containers at the end of any month.
- Initially, at the start of the first month, the yard has \var{init_container} containers.
- The yard should not contain any containers after the end of the last month.
- Additionally, loading containers onto ships necessitates the rental of cranes.
- A maximum of \var{num_cranes} cranes can be rented each month, each having a capacity to load \var{crane_capacity} containers.
- It costs \var{crane_cost} for each crane.

INPUT FORMAT: 

{
    "demands": [demand_{t} for t in 1, ..., T],
    "unload_costs": [unload_cost_{t} for t in 1, ..., T],
    "unload_capacity": [unload_capacity_{t} for t in 1, ..., T],
    "holding_cost": holding_cost,

    "init_container": init_container,
    "num_cranes": num_cranes,
    "crane_capacity": crane_capacity,
    "crane_cost": crane_cost,
}

OBJECTIVE: Determine a strategy to minimize costs from unloading, storage, and crane rentals over the period.

OUTPUT INFO:

- \var{amount_{t}} indicates the number of containers unloaded for each month.
- \var{crane_{t}} specifies the number of cranes rented for each month.
- \var{total_cost} shows the total cost of the company over the period.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

{
    "containers_unloaded": [amount_{t} for t in 1, ..., T],
    "cranes_rented": [crane_{t} for t in 1, ..., T],
    "total_cost": total_cost
