    "description": "The Aircraft Assignment Problem is a mathematical programming model that aims to assign \\param{TotalAircraft} aircraft to \\param{TotalRoutes} routes in order to minimize the total cost while satisfying availability and demand constraints. The availability for each aircraft i is \\param{Availability_i} and it represents the maximum number of routes that the aircraft can be assigned to. The demand for each route j is \\param{Demand_j} and it denotes the number of aircraft required to fulfill the passenger or cargo needs of the route. The capability of each aircraft i for each route j is given by \\param{Capacity_{i,j}} and it defines whether the aircraft can service the route, considering factors such as range, size, and suitability. Finally, \\param{Cost_{i,j}} represents the cost of assigning aircraft i to route j, which includes operational, fuel, and potential opportunity costs.",
