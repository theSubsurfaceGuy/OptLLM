    "description": "The Car Selection Problem is a mixed integer programming model that aims to assign \\param{ParticipantNum} participants to \\param{CarNum} cars in a way that maximizes the total number of assignments. Each participant is interested in a subset of cars, represented by \\param{InterestMatrix_{p,c}}, where p and c index participants and cars, respectively. The objective is to find the optimal assignment of participants to cars that satisfies certain constraints.",
