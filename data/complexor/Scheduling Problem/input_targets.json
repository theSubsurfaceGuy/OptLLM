Each employee has a set of skills out of \\param{NumSkills} possible skills, and each restaurant has a demand for skilled employees during each shift. The objective is to minimize the cost of the schedule, which includes the cost of unfulfilled positions (each weighted by \\param{UnfulfilledPositionWeight}) and the cost of assigning employees to less preferred positions (indicated by their preference levels for each skill).",
