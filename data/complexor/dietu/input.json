    "description": "Consider a diet problem. Given a set of foods \\param{FoodSet} and a set of nutrients \\param{NutrientSet} which is the union of nutrients with minimum requirements \\param{MinReqNutrients} and nutrients with maximum requirements \\param{MaxReqNutrients}. Each food \\param{j} has a cost \\param{CostPerFood_j} and the amount of each nutrient \\param{i} it contains is \\param{AmountPerNutrient_{i,j}}. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of buying foods. It is constrained that the total amount of each nutrient \\param{i} with minimum requirements in the foods bought is at least \\param{MinReqAmount_i} and the total amount of each nutrient \\param{i} with maximum requirements in the foods bought is at most \\param{MaxReqAmount_i}. How to decide the amount of each food \\param{j} to buy ?",
