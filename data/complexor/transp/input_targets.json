Each origin has a certain supply \\param{SupplyOfOrigin}, and each destination has a certain demand \\param{DemandOfDestination}. The goal is to minimize the total cost of transportation \\param{TransportationCost}. The cost of transporting from an origin i to a destination j is given by \\param{CostPerUnit_{i,j}}.
