    "description": "Lot-sizing problems are production planning problems where \\param{Periods} are predefined and production of an item during a \\param{Periods} involves a discrete event such as the payment of a cost or the loss of production capacity. These events can occur due to the placement of an order or the set-up, startup, or changeover of a machine. The demand for each of the \\param{Items} across each period is represented by \\param{Demand_{i,j}}, while the total production capacity available in each period is defined by \\param{TotalPeriodCapacity_j}. Each item has a specific capacity \\param{ItemCapacity_{i,j}} which could decrease in each period due to mentioned events. Holding costs for items are indicated by \\param{HoldingCost_i}, while backorder costs and fixed order costs are represented by \\param{BackorderCost_i} and \\param{FixedCost_i}, respectively. The initial stock of each item is provided by \\param{InitialStock_i}.",
