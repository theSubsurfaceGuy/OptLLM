    "description": "Consider a diet problem. Given a set of nutrients \\param{NutrientCount} and a set of foods \\param{FoodCount}. Each food j has a cost \\param{Cost_j} and a range of amount that can be bought [\\param{FoodMin_j}, \\param{FoodMax_j}]. Each nutrient i has a range of amount that should be included in the diet [\\param{NutrientMin_i}, \\param{NutrientMax_i}]. The amount of nutrient i in food j is \\param{AmountNutrient_{i, j}}. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of buying foods. It is constrained that the total amount of each nutrient i in the bought foods should be within its range. How to decide the amount of each food j to buy?",
