    "description": "A cleaning company uses a cleansing chemical and odor-removing chemical to clean a house. Each unit of the cleansing chemical takes \\param{Tc} units to be effective while each unit of the odor-removing chemical takes \\param{To} minutes to be effective. The company must use at least \\param{MinCleansing} units of the cleansing chemical. In total, at least \\param{MaxTotal} units of chemicals can be used per house. Further, because the cleansing chemical is strong, there can be at most \\param{MaxRatio} times the amount of cleansing chemical as odor-removing chemical. How many units of each should be used to minimize the total time it takes for a house to be cleaned?"
