    "description": "An amusement park is installing ticket machines, both cash-based and card-only machines. A cash-based machine can process \\var{RateCash} people per hour while a card-only machine can process \\var{RateCard} people per hour. The cash-based machine needs \\var{PaperCash} rolls of paper per hour while the card-only machine requires \\var{PaperCard} rolls of paper per hour. The amusement park needs to be able to process at least \\var{MinPeople} people per hour but can use at most \\var{MaxPaper} rolls of paper per hour. Since most people prefer to pay by cash, the number of card-only machines must not exceed the number of cash-based machines. How many of each machine should be bought to minimize the total number of machines in the park?",
