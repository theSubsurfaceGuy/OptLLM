    "description": "A factory provides rides for its employees in either taxis or company cars. Each taxi ride can take \\param{TaxiCapacity} employees while each company car ride can take \\param{CarCapacity} employees. Since buying and maintaining cars is expensive, at most \\param{MaxCarRideProportion} of the rides can be company car rides. However, there has to be at least \\param{MinCarRides} company car rides. If the company needs to transport at least \\param{MinEmployees} employees, how many rides of each should be done to minimize the total number of taxi rides."
