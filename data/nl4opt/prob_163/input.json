    "description": "A farmer decides to move his cows to a nearby farm using helicopters and trucks. A helicopter can take \\param{CowsPerHelicopter} cows per trip and creates \\param{PollutionPerHelicopter} units of pollution. A truck can take \\param{CowsPerTruck} cows per trip and creates \\param{PollutionPerTruck} units of pollution. The farmer needs to transport \\param{TotalCows} cows and he only has enough money for at most \\param{MaxTruckTrips} truck trips. How many of each type of trip should be taken to minimize the total amount of pollution produced?"
