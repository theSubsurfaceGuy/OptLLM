    "description": "A pharmaceutical company makes skin cream in batches, a regular batch and premium batch, to sell to hospitals. The regular batch requires \\param{MedicinalIngredientsRegular} units of medicinal ingredients and \\param{RehydrationProductRegular} units of rehydration product. A premium batch requires \\param{MedicinalIngredientsPremium} units of medicinal ingredients and \\param{RehydrationProductPremium} units of rehydration product. The company has available \\param{TotalMedicinalIngredients} units of medicinal ingredients and \\param{TotalRehydrationProduct} units of rehydration product. Since the premium batch sells better, the number of regular batches must be less than the number of premium batches. In addition, the company must make at least \\param{MinRegularBatches} regular batches. If a regular batch can treat \\param{PeopleTreatedRegular} people and a premium batch can treat \\param{PeopleTreatedPremium} people, how many of each batch should be made to maximize the number of people that can be treated?"
