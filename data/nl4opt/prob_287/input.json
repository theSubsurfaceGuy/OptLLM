    "description": "A hospital needs to transport \\param{TotalPatients} patients every day. A type II ambulance can move \\param{AmbulanceCapacity} patients every shift and costs the hospital \\param{AmbulanceCost}. A hospital van can move \\param{VanCapacity} patients and costs the hospital \\param{VanCost} every shift. The hospital can have at most \\param{MaxVanShiftProportion} of shifts be hospital vans due to union limitations of the type II ambulance drivers. How many shifts using each type of vehicle should be scheduled to minimize the total cost to the hospital?"
