    "description": "A clinic makes batches of vitamin shots and pills. Each batch of vitamin shots requires \\param{VitaminCShot} units of vitamin C and \\param{VitaminDShot} units of vitamin D. Each batch of vitamin pills requires \\param{VitaminCPill} units of vitamin C and \\param{VitaminDPill} units of vitamin D. Since pills are more popular, the number of batches of vitamin pills must be larger than the number of batches of vitamin shots. Further, the clinic can make at most \\param{MaxShotBatches} batches of vitamin shots. The clinic has available \\param{TotalVitaminC} units of vitamin C and \\param{TotalVitaminD} units of vitamin D. If each batch of vitamin shots can supply \\param{PeoplePerShot} people and each batch of vitamin pills can supply \\param{PeoplePerPill} people, how many batches of each should be made to maximize the number of people that can be supplied?"
