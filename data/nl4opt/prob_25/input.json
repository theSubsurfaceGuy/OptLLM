The money invested in apartments must not be greater than \\param{MaxApartments}. They have decided that the money invested in apartments must be at least \\param{MinInvestmentRatio} as much as that in townhouses. If the apartments earn \\param{ProfitRateApts}, and the townhouses earn \\param{ProfitRateTH}, how much money should they invest in each to maximize profit?"
