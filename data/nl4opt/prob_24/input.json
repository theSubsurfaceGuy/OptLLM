The store has available \\param{PaintAvailable} units of paint, \\param{GlitterAvailable} units of glitter, and \\param{GlueAvailable} units of glue. To make a large art piece requires \\param{PaintLarge} units of paint, \\param{GlitterLarge} units of glitter, and \\param{GlueLarge} units of glue. To make a small art piece requires \\param{PaintSmall} units of paint, \\param{GlitterSmall} units of glitter, and \\param{GlueSmall} units of glue. The store must make at least \\param{MinLarge} units of each large and small art pieces. If the profit per large art piece is $\\param{ProfitLarge} and the profit per small art piece is $\\param{ProfitSmall}, how many of each should be made to maximize profit?"
