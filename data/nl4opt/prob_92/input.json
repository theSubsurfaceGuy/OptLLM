    "description": "A toy company can build two factory types, a medium-sized factory and a small factory. A medium-sized factory can make \\param{ToysMedium} toys per day and requires \\param{OperatorsMedium} operators. A small factory can make \\param{ToysSmall} toys per day and requires \\param{OperatorsSmall} operators. The company must make at least \\param{ToysMin} toys per day but they only have \\param{OperatorsTotal} operators available. How many of each factory should the company build to minimize the total number of factories?"
