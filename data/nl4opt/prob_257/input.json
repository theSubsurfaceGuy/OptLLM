    "description": "Platinum in combination with palladium has been used as a catalyst in cars and it changes carbon monoxide, which is toxic, into carbon dioxide. An automotive company is comparing two different catalysts, a palladium-heavy catalyst and a platinum-heavy catalyst. The process with a palladium-heavy catalyst requires \\param{PlatinumPalladiumHeavy} units of platinum and \\param{PalladiumPalladiumHeavy} units of palladium and can perform the conversion to carbon dioxide at a rate of \\param{ConversionRatePalladiumHeavy} units per second. A platinum-heavy catalyst requires \\param{PlatinumPlatinumHeavy} units of platinum and \\param{PalladiumPlatinumHeavy} units of palladium and converts to carbon dioxide at a rate of \\param{ConversionRatePlatinumHeavy} units per second. There are \\param{TotalPlatinum} units of platinum and \\param{TotalPalladium} units of palladium available. How many of each catalyst should be used to maximize the amount converted into carbon dioxide?"
