    "description": "A pharmaceutical company has \\param{TotalPainkillerUnits} units of painkiller medicine and makes daytime and nighttime painkiller pills. A daytime pill has \\param{DaytimePainkillerUnits} units of painkiller medicine and \\param{DaytimeSleepUnits} units of sleep medicine. A nighttime pill has \\param{NighttimePainkillerUnits} units of painkiller medicine and \\param{NighttimeSleepUnits} units of sleep medicine. Since some people don\u2019t want the sleeping effect, at least \\param{MinimumDaytimePercentage} of the pills must be daytime pills. However, at least \\param{MinimumNighttimePills} nighttime pills must be made. How many of each pill should be made to minimize the total amount of sleep medicine required?"
