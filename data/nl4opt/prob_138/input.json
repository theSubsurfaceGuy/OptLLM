    "description": "A university research lab can make two types of diabetes medicine, medicine A and medicine B. Per dose, medicine A takes \\param{MaterialA} units of imported material and \\param{MrnaA} units of mRNA to make. Per dose, medicine B takes \\param{MaterialB} units of imported material and \\param{MrnaB} units of mRNA to take. The lab has available at most \\param{TotalMaterial} units of imported material and \\param{TotalMrna} units of mRNA. The lab can make at most \\param{MaxDosesA} doses of medicine A and the number of doses of medicine B must be larger than the number of doses of medicine A. If one dose of medicine A can treat \\param{PeopleA} people and one dose of medicine B can treat \\param{PeopleB} people, how many doses of each should be made to maximize the number of people that can be treated?"
