    "description": "A candle-making company can move their inventory of candles using freight and air. Freight can transport \\param{FreightCapacity} tons per trip while using air can transport \\param{AirCapacity} tons per trip. Since freight take longer, the cost for each freight trip is \\param{FreightCost} while the cost over air for each trip is \\param{AirCost}. The company needs to transport at least \\param{MinimumTons} tons of candles and they have a budget of \\param{Budget}. Additionally, due to some urgent orders, at least \\param{AirFraction} of tons of candles must be transported through air. There must also be at least \\param{MinimumFreightTrips} trips through freight. How many of trip by each should be scheduled to minimize the total number of trips?"
