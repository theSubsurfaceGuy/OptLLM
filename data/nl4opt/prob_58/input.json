    "description": "A honey farmer sells his honey in glass and plastic jars. A glass jar can hold \\param{VolGlass} ml of honey while a plastic jar can hold \\param{VolPlastic} ml of honey. Since glass jars are more expensive, at least \\param{MinRatio} times as many plastic jars must be filled as glass jars. However, at least \\param{MinGlass} glass jars should be filled. If the farmer has \\param{TotalHoney} ml of honey, how many jars of each should be filled to maximize the total number of bottles filled?"
