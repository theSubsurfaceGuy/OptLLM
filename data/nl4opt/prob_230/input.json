    "description": "A student takes calcium pills and vitamin D pills one after the other. Each calcium pill takes \\param{Tc} minutes to be effective while each vitamin D pill takes \\param{Td} minutes to be effective. Over a month, the student must take at least \\param{Pmin} pills of medication and at least \\param{Dmin} should be vitamin D pills because they enhance the absorption of calcium in the body. Since vitamin D is complimentary to calcium, the student must take more calcium pills than vitamin D pills. How many pills of each should the student take to minimize the total time it takes for the medication to be effective?"
