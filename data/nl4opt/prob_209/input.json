    "description": "Lucy has a dog and she wants his food to be mixed. In order to keep the dog healthy but also keep the food tasty, the mix needs to have a minimum of \\param{CalciumMin} units of calcium, \\param{VitaminMixMin} units of vitamin mix, and \\param{ProteinMin} units of protein. A regular brand costs \\param{CostRegular} per bag and contains \\param{CalciumRegular} units of calcium, \\param{VitaminMixRegular} units of vitamin mix, and \\param{ProteinRegular} units of protein. A premium brand costs \\param{CostPremium} per bag and contains \\param{CalciumPremium} units of calcium, \\param{VitaminMixPremium} units of vitamin mix, and \\param{ProteinPremium} units of protein. How many bags of each brand should Lucy mix in order to minimize cost while also meeting the taste and health requirements."
