    "description": "A recycling company collects recycling from neighborhoods using small and large bins. A small bin requires \\param{SmallBinWorkers} workers while a large bin requires \\param{LargeBinWorkers} workers. A small bin can hold \\param{SmallBinCapacity} units of recycling material and a large bin can hold \\param{LargeBinCapacity} units of recycling material. The company has available \\param{TotalWorkers} workers. Because most people don't recycle, the number of small bins must be \\param{BinRatio} times the number of large bins. In addition, there must be at least \\param{MinSmallBins} small bins and \\param{MinLargeBins} large bins. How many of each bin type should be used to maximize the total amount of recycling material that can be collected?"
