    "description": "A store employs senior citizens who earn \\param{WageSenior} per week and young adults who earn \\param{WageYoung} per week. The store must keep the weekly wage bill below \\param{MaxWageBill}. On any day, the store requires at least \\param{MinWorkers} workers, of whom at least \\param{MinYoung} must be young adults. To ensure the store runs smoothly, the number of young adults should be at least \\param{YoungToSeniorRatio} the number of senior citizens. Formulate a LP to minimize the wage bill."
