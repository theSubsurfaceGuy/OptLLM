    "description": "There is \\param{TotalGold} mg of gold available that is needed to make long and short cables. Long cables require \\param{GoldLong} mg of gold while short cables require \\param{GoldShort} mg of gold. Because of their compact size, at least \\param{RatioShortLong} times the number of short cables are needed than the long cables. In addition, there needs to be at least \\param{MinLong} long cables made. If each long cable sold results in a \\param{ProfitLong} profit and each short cable sold results in a \\param{ProfitShort} profit, how many of each type of cable should be made to maximize profit?"
