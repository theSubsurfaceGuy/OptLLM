    "description": "A company is deciding where to promote their product. Some options include z-tube, soorchle engine, and wassa advertisements. The cost for each option and the number of viewers they each attract is given. On z-tube, each ad costs \\$\\param{CostZtube} and attracts \\param{ViewersZtube} viewers. On soorchle, each ad costs \\$\\param{CostSoorchle} and attracts \\param{ViewersSoorchle} viewers. On wassa, each ad costs \\$\\param{CostWassa} and attracts \\param{ViewersWassa} viewers. Soorchle limits the number of advertisements from a single company to \\param{MaxAdsSoorchle}. Moreover, in order to balance the advertising among the three types of media, at most \\param{MaxPropWassa} of the total number of advertisements should occur on wassa. And at least \\param{MinPropZtube} should occur on z-tube. The weekly advertising budget is \\$\\param{Budget}. How many advertisements should be run in each of the three types of media to maximize the total audience?"
