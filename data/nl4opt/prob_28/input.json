A phone will earn the store \\param{ProfitPhone} in profits, and a laptop will earn \\param{ProfitLaptop}. A phone requires \\param{SpacePhone} sq ft of floor space, whereas a laptop requires \\param{SpaceLaptop} sq ft. In total, \\param{TotalSpace} sq ft of floor space is available. The store stocks only phones and laptops. Corporate has required that at least \\param{MinLaptopRatio} of all appliances in stock be laptops.

Formulate an LP that can be used to maximize the store's profit."
