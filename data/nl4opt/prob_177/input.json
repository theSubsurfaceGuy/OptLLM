    "description": "A corn farmer sends his corn to the city by either tractor or car. A tractor can carry \\param{Tc} kg of corn while a car can carry \\param{Cc} kg of corn. Since tractors are very slow, the number of cars used has to be at least \\param{Ratio} times the number of tractors used. If at least \\param{MinCorn} kg of corn need to be sent to the city, minimize the total number of tractors and cars needed."
