The small container requires \\param{WaterSmall} units of water and \\param{PillSmall} units of the powdered pill to make \\param{PasteSmall} units of the paste. The large container requires \\param{WaterLarge} units of water and \\param{PillLarge} units of the powdered pill to make \\param{PasteLarge} units of the paste. The pharmacy has available \\param{TotalWater} units of water and \\param{TotalPill} units of the powdered pill. How many of each container should be used to maximize the amount of paste that can be made?"
