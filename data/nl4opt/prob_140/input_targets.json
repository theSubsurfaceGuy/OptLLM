Beam 1 delivers a dose of \\param{DosePancreas1} units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the pancreas and \\param{DoseSkin1} units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the skin. Beam 2 delivers \\param{DosePancreas2} units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the pancreas and \\param{DoseSkin2} units of medicine per minute to the benign area of the skin. In addition, beam 1 delivers \\param{DoseTumor1} units of medicine per minute to the tumor and beam 2 delivers \\param{DoseTumor2} units of medicine per minute to the tumor. At most \\param{MaxSkinDose} units of medicine should be received by the skin and at least \\param{MinTumorDose} units of medicine should be delivered to the tumor.
