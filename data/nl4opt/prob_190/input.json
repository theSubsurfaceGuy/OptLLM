    "description": "A grape farmer transports his grapes in either small crates or large crates. A small crate can take \\param{SmallCrateCapacity} grapes while a large crate can take \\param{LargeCrateCapacity}. Because his customers prefer smaller crates, at least \\param{SmallToLargeRatio} times as many small crates must be used than large crates. The farmer has available at most \\param{MaxSmallCrates} small crates and at most \\param{MaxLargeCrates} large crates. In addition, his truck can take at most \\param{MaxTotalCrates} crates total and he must use at least \\param{MinLargeCrates} large crates. How many of each crate should he use to maximize the total number of grapes he can transport?"
