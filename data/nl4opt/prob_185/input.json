A golden retriever can deliver \\param{GoldenRetrieverNewspaperCount} newspapers at a time and requires \\param{GoldenRetrieverBoneTreatCount} small bone treats per service. The school only has \\param{TotalBoneTreatsAvailable} small bone treats available. In addition, at least \\param{MinGoldenRetrievers} golden retrievers must be used and at most \\param{MaxLabradorProportion} of the dogs can be labradors.
