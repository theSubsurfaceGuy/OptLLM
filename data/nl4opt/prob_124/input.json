    "description": "A boy needs to get enough magnesium and zinc in his diet by eating chewable gummies and taking pills. Each gummy contains \\param{MgGummy} units of magnesium and \\param{ZnGummy} units of zinc. Each pill contains \\param{MgPill} units of magnesium and \\param{ZnPill} units of zinc. The boy must take at least \\param{MinPills} pills. Since he prefers gummies more, he must eat at least \\param{GummyPillRatio} times the amount of gummies as pills. If the boy can consume at most \\param{MaxMg} units of magnesium, how many of each should he eat to maximize his zinc intake?"
