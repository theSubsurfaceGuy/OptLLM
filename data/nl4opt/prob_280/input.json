    "description": "A daycare center has children they must pick up and can use two types of vehicles: a bus with a capacity of \\param{BusCapacity} children or a personal car with a capacity of \\param{CarCapacity} children. The daycare has to pick up at least \\param{MinChildren} children. Additionally, due to limitations of pollution, there must be more buses than personal cars. But some children require extra attention. Therefore, there must be at least \\param{MinCars} personal cars. How many of each form of transportation should the daycare center schedule for to minimize the total number of vehicles?"
