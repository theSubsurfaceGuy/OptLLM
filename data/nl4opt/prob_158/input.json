    "description": "A school is organizing a field trip to a science center and wants to hire small buses (each with a capacity of \\param{SmallBusCapacity} students) and large buses (each with a capacity of \\param{LargeBusCapacity} students). The school needs to provide transportation for at least \\param{MinStudents} students. In addition, since the parking lot is rather small, a maximum of \\param{MaxLargeBusProportion} of the buses can be large buses. How many of each type of bus should be hired to minimize the total number of buses?"
