    "description": "A man takes two supplements to get his daily iron and calcium requirements. A pill of supplement A has \\param{IronA} units of iron and \\param{CalciumA} units of calcium. A pill of supplement B contains \\param{IronB} units of iron and \\param{CalciumB} units of calcium. The man needs a minimum of \\param{IronReq} units of iron and \\param{CalciumReq} units of calcium per day. If the cost per pill of supplement A is $\\param{CostA} and the cost per pill of supplement B is $\\param{CostB}, how many of each should he buy to minimize costs?"
