    "description": "A flooring company produces engineered laminate planks and carpets. The chief marketer reports an expected demand of at least \\param{Dlaminate} square feet of laminate planks and \\param{Dcarpet} square feet of carpets each week. The shipping contract requires a total of at least \\param{Dtotal} square feet of products each week. However, due to a shortage of raw materials, no more than \\param{Claminate} square feet of laminate planks and \\param{Ccarpet} square feet of carpets can be produced weekly. If a square foot of laminate planks produces a \\param{Plaminate} profit and a square foot of carpets yields a \\param{Pcarpet} profit, how many of each type of product should be made weekly to maximize the company's profit?"
