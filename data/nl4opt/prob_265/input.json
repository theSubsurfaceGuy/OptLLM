    "description": "A golf course is hosting an event and can transport guests using either golf carts or pull carts. A golf cart can take \\param{GolfCartCapacity} guests while a pull cart can take \\param{PullCartCapacity} guest. Since golf carts take up a lot of space, at most \\param{MaxGolfCartProportion} of carts can be golf carts. If the golf course needs to transport at least \\param{MinGuests} guests, how many of each cart should be used to minimize the total number of carts needed?"
