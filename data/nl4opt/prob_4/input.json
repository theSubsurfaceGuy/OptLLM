    "description": "A lighting company makes desk-lamps and night-lamps. There is an expected demand of at least \\param{MinDesk} desk-lamps and \\param{MinNight} night-lamps each day. However, due to the size of their factory, they can make at most \\param{MaxDesk} desk-lamps and \\param{MaxNight} night-lamps per day. To satisfy a contract, a minimum of \\param{MinTotal} lamps must be made each day. If the profit per desk-lamp sold is \\param{ProfitDesk} and the profit per night-lamp sold is \\param{ProfitNight}, how many lamps of each type should be made to maximize profit?"
