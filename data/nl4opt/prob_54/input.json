    "description": "A woodshop can purchase two types of saws, a miter saw and a circular saw. A miter saw can cut \\param{MiterPlanks} planks of wood and produces \\param{MiterSawdust} units of sawdust per day. A circular saw can cut \\param{CircularPlanks} planks of wood and produces \\param{CircularSawdust} units of sawdust per day. The woodshop must cut at least \\param{MinPlanks} planks of wood per day. However, to avoid too much pollution in the woodshop, they can produce at most \\param{MaxSawdust} units of sawdust per day. How many of each type of saw should be purchased to minimize the total number of saws needed?"
