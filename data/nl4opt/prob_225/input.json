    "description": "The government is reworking the pipes to transport water to houses in the area. The water can be transported through wide pipes or narrow pipes. Wide pipes can transport \\param{WidePipeCapacity} units of water per minute and narrow pipes can transport \\param{NarrowPipeCapacity} units of water per minute. Due to logistics, the number of wide pipes can be at most \\param{MaxWideToNarrowRatio} times the number of narrow pipes. If there needs to be at least \\param{MinTotalWater} units of water transported every minute, and at least \\param{MinWidePipes} wide pipes must be used, minimize the total number of pipes required."
