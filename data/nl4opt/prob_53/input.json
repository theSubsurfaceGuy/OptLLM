Process A requires \\param{GoldA} units of gold, \\param{WireA} wires, and can plate \\param{CoinsA} coins. Process B requires \\param{GoldB} units of gold, \\param{WireB} wires, and can plate \\param{CoinsB} coins. There are \\param{TotalGold} units of gold and \\param{TotalWires} wires available. How many processes of each type should be run to maximize the total number of coins that can be plated?"
