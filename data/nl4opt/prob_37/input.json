    "description": "A food truck owner can spend at most \\param{MaxBudget} on mangos and guavas. A mango costs the food truck owner \\param{CostMango} and a guava costs him \\param{CostGuava}. Spices are added and each mango is sold for a profit of \\param{ProfitMango} while each guava is sold for a profit of \\param{ProfitGuava}. The owner estimates that at least \\param{MinMangos} mangos but at the most \\param{MaxMangos} are sold each month. He also estimates that the number of guavas sold is at most a third of the mangos sold (expressed as \\param{RatioGuavas} times the number of mangos). How many mangos and guavas should be sold in order to maximize the profit?"
