    "description": "A suspicious factory has \\param{S} sq. feet of space. It makes bootleg phones and laptops. Phones require \\param{LPhone} hours of labor and cost \\param{CPhone} for each sq. foot of space allocated for phone production (cost of electricity and equipment). Laptops require \\param{LLaptop} hours of labor and cost \\param{CLaptop} for each sq. foot of space allocated for laptop production. Phones produce a net revenue of \\param{RPhone} per sq. foot while laptops produce a net revenue of \\param{RLaptop} per sq. foot. The factory wants to spend at most \\param{BudgetMax} and \\param{LaborMax} hours of labor. What is the optimal factory layout to maximize revenue?"
