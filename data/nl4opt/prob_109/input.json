    "description": "A clinic takes patient blood pressure either using an automatic machine or a manual machine. The automatic machine takes \\param{TAuto} minutes per patient while the manual machine takes \\param{TManual} minutes per patient. Since the automatic machine frequently breaks, at least \\param{RatioManualToAuto} times as many patients must have their blood pressure taken by the manual machine than the automatic machine. However, at least \\param{MinPatientsAuto} patients can be processed by the automatic machine. If the clinic is open for \\param{TotalTime} minutes, maximize the number of patients whose blood pressure can be taken."
