    "description": "A glass factory makes two types of glass panes: a regular glass pane and a tempered glass pane. Both require time on a heating and cooling machine. Both machines are available for a maximum of \\param{MaxTime} minutes per day. It takes \\param{TimeRegHeat} minutes in the heating machine and \\param{TimeRegCool} minutes in the cooling machine to make one regular glass pane. It takes \\param{TimeTempHeat} minutes in the heating machine and \\param{TimeTempCool} minutes in the cooling machine to make one tempered glass pane. The profit per pane of regular glass is \\param{ProfitReg} and the profit per pane of tempered glass is \\param{ProfitTemp}. How many panes of each glass type should the factory make to maximize profit? What is the maximum profit?"
