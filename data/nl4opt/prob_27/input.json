    "description": "A hobbyist makes model trains and planes using wood and paint. A model train requires \\param{WoodTrain} units of wood and \\param{PaintTrain} units of paint. A model plane requires \\param{WoodPlane} units of wood and \\param{PaintPlane} units of paint. The hobbyist has available \\param{TotalWood} units of wood and \\param{TotalPaint} units of paint. If the profit per model train is $\\param{ProfitTrain} and the profit per model plane is $\\param{ProfitPlane}, how many of each should be made to maximize his profit?"
