    "background": "A biotechnology company uses a limited supply of antibiotics to produce first-dose and second-dose vaccines, both of which also require gelatine. The production must result in more first-dose vaccines than second-dose vaccines while meeting a minimum production requirement for the second-dose.",
    "constraints": [
        "The number of first-dose vaccines is non-negative",
        "The number of second-dose vaccines is non-negative",
        "The total antibiotics used cannot exceed the AntibioticsAvailable units",
        "The number of first-dose vaccines must be greater than the number of second-dose vaccines",
        "At least MinimumSecondDose second-dose vaccines must be produced"
    ],
    "objective": "Minimize the total amount of gelatine used in the vaccine production",
    "description": "A biotechnology company has AntibioticsAvailable units of antibiotics available which is important to the process of making a first-dose and second-dose of vaccines. The first-dose vaccine requires AntibioticsFirstDose units of antibiotics and GelatineFirstDose mg of gelatine whereas the second-dose vaccine requires AntibioticsSecondDose units of antibiotics and GelatineSecondDose mg of gelatine. Since the first-dose vaccine is required before the second-dose vaccine, there must be more first-dose than second-dose vaccines manufactured. However, at least MinimumSecondDose second-dose vaccines must be made. How many of each vaccine should be made to minimize the amount of gelatine used?",
