    "description": "A woman eats cashews and almonds to get her calorie and protein intake. A serving of almonds contains \\param{CaloriesAlmonds} calories and \\param{ProteinAlmonds} grams of protein. A serving of cashews contains \\param{CaloriesCashews} calories and \\param{ProteinCashews} grams of protein. The woman decides to eat at least twice as many servings of almonds as cashews. Furthermore, a serving of almonds contains \\param{FatAlmonds} grams of fat while a serving of cashews contains \\param{FatCashews} grams of fat. If the woman needs to consume at least \\param{MinCalories} calories and \\param{MinProtein} grams of protein this week, how many servings of each should she eat to minimize her fat intake?"
