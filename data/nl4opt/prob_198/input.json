They have vans which can carry \\param{VanCapacity} people and cars which can carry \\param{CarCapacity} people. They need to transport at least \\param{MinimumVoters} voters to the polls. In addition, at most \\param{MaxVansRatio} of the vehicles can be vans. How many of each vehicle should be used to minimize the total number of cars used?"
