    "description": "A shipping company can purchase regular and hybrid vans to make deliveries. A regular van can deliver \\param{PackagesRegular} packages per day and produces \\param{PollutantsRegular} units of pollutants. A hybrid van can deliver \\param{PackagesHybrid} packages per day and produces \\param{PollutantsHybrid} units of pollutants. Due to a new environmental law, they can produce at most \\param{MaxPollutants} units of pollutants per day. However, the company needs to be able to deliver at least \\param{MinPackages} packages per day. How many of each type of van should they buy to minimize the total number of vans needed?"
