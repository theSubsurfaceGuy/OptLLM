    "description": "A flooring company produces engineered hardwood and vinyl planks. Their sales forecasts show an expected demand of at least \\param{MinHardwood} square feet of hardwood and \\param{MinVinyl} square feet of vinyl planks each week. To satisfy a shipping contract, a total of at least \\param{MinTotalShip} square feet of flooring must be shipped each week. Due to a labor shortage issue, no more than \\param{MaxHardwoodProd} square feet of hardwood and \\param{MaxVinylProd} square feet of vinyl can be produced weekly. If a square foot of hardwood flooring yields a profit of \\param{ProfitHardwood} and a square foot of vinyl planks produces a \\param{ProfitVinyl} profit, how many of each type of flooring should be made weekly to maximize the company's profit?"
