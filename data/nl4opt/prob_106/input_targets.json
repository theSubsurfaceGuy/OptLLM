    "description": "A drug company is making allergy pills and fever reducing pills in two factories, factory 1 and factory 2. Factory 1 produces \\param{AllergyPillsFactory1} allergy pills and \\param{FeverPillsFactory1} fever reducing pills per hour. Factory 2 produces \\param{AllergyPillsFactory2} allergy pills and \\param{FeverPillsFactory2} fever reducing pills per hour. Factory 1 is much more efficient and only requires \\param{CompoundFactory1} units of a rare compound while factory 2 requires \\param{CompoundFactory2} units of a rare compound. The company only has available \\param{TotalCompound} units of the rare compound. If the company must make at least \\param{MinAllergyPills} allergy pills and \\param{MinFeverPills} fever reducing pills, how many hours should each factory be run to minimize the total time needed?",
