    "description": "A keyboard manufacturer makes mechanical and standard keyboards. The manufacturer aims to have \\param{RatioMechanicalStandard} times as many mechanical than standard keyboards. A mechanical keyboard costs \\param{PlasticPerMechanical} units of plastic and \\param{SolderPerMechanical} units of solder whereas a standard keyboard costs \\param{PlasticPerStandard} units of plastic and \\param{SolderPerStandard} unit of solder. There must be at least \\param{MinStandard} standard keyboards. If the company has available \\param{TotalPlastic} units of plastic and \\param{TotalSolder} units of solder, how many of each type should be manufactured to maximize the total number of keyboards?"
