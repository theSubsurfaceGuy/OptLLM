    "description": "An office supply company makes two types of printers: color printers and black and white printers. Different sections of the factory with different teams produce each printer. The color printer team can produce at most \\param{MaxColor} color printers per day while the black and white printer team can produce at most \\param{MaxBW} black and white printers per day. Both teams require use of the same paper tray installing machine and this machine can make at most \\param{MaxTotal} printers of either type each day. Color printers generate a profit of \\param{ProfitColor} per printer while black and white printers generate a profit of \\param{ProfitBW} per printer. How many of each printer should be made to maximize the company's profit?"
