    "description": "A dietician recommends her client eat blueberries and strawberries to meet her anti-oxidant and mineral requirement. A pack of blueberries contains \\param{BlueberryAntioxidants} units of anti-oxidants and \\param{BlueberryMinerals} units of minerals. A pack of strawberries contains \\param{StrawberryAntioxidants} unit of anti-oxidants and \\param{StrawberryMinerals} units of minerals. The client must get at least \\param{MinAntioxidants} units of anti-oxidants and \\param{MinMinerals} units of minerals. In addition, because blueberries are not in season, the dietician recommends she eats at least 3 times as many packs of strawberries as blueberries. This is expressed as a strawberry to blueberry ratio of \\param{StrawberryBlueberryRatio}. If a pack of blueberries contains \\param{BlueberrySugar} grams of sugar and a pack of strawberries contains \\param{StrawberrySugar} grams of sugar, how many of packs of each should she consume to minimize her sugar intake?"
