    "description": "Sleep inducing medicine and anti-inflammatory medicine are found in two pills, pill A and pill B. One pill A contains \\param{SleepA} units of sleep inducing medicine and \\param{AntiInflA} units of anti-inflammatory medicine. One pill B contains \\param{SleepB} units of sleep-inducing medicine and \\param{AntiInflB} unit of anti-inflammatory medicine. The cost per pill for pill A is \\param{CostA} and the cost per pill for pill B is \\param{CostB}. A patient must consume these two pills to get at least \\param{MinSleep} units of sleep-inducing medicine and \\param{MinAntiInfl} units of anti-inflammatory medicine. Formulate an LP to minimize the cost for the patient."
