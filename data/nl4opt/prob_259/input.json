    "description": "An airport can either install escalators or elevators. Escalators can transport \\param{EscalatorRate} people every minute whereas elevators can transport \\param{ElevatorRate} people every minute. Escalators take up \\param{EscalatorSpace} units of space while elevators take \\param{ElevatorSpace} units of space. The airport needs to have enough capacity to transport at least \\param{CapacityMinimum} people every minute. Additionally, there must be at least \\param{EscalatorElevatorRatio} times more escalators than elevators and at least \\param{ElevatorMinNumber} elevators must be used. How many of each type should the airport install to minimize the total units of space taken?"
