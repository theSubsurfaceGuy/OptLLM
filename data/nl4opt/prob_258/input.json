    "description": "There are two ways to extract metal from mined ores. The first way is to use process J and the second is process P. Process J can extract \\param{MetalJ} units of metal using \\param{WaterJ} units of water and produces \\param{PollutionJ} units of pollution. Process P can extract \\param{MetalP} units of metal using \\param{WaterP} units of water and produces \\param{PollutionP} units of pollution. There can be at most \\param{MaxWater} units of water and \\param{MaxPollution} units of pollution. How many of each type of processes should be performed to maximize the amount of metal extracted?"
