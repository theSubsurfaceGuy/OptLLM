    "description": "A researcher is outsourcing annotations and has two options: a specialized third-party or a common third-party annotation company. The specialized company can annotate at a rate of \\param{SpecializedRate} images per hour whereas the common company can annotate at a rate of \\param{CommonRate} images per hour. However, the specialized company charges \\param{SpecializedCharge} per hour and the common company charges \\param{CommonCharge} per hour. The researcher has deadlines to meet and must complete a dataset of at least \\param{MinimumImages} images. They also have some special images that only the specialized company can annotate. Therefore, at least a \\param{MinimumSpecializedProportion} of work must be allocated to the specialized company. How should the researcher distribute the annotations to the two companies to minimize the cost of annotating the whole dataset?"
