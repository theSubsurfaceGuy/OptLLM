Trolleys can transport \\param{TrolleyRate} kg/min of equipment and requires \\param{TrolleyWorkers} workers. There must be at least \\param{MinTrolleys} trolleys to be used. Additionally, only a maximum of \\param{MaxTrolleyPercentage} of the transportation can be using trolleys. The organizer has to deliver at a rate of \\param{DeliveryRate} kg/min of equipment. How many of each transportation method should be used to minimize the total number of workers?"
