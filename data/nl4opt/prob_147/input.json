    "description": "An engineering school has a bridge building competition where students must build as many beam bridges and truss bridges as they can using Popsicle sticks and glue. A beam bridge requires \\param{PopsicleBeam} Popsicle sticks and \\param{GlueBeam} units of glue while a truss bridge requires \\param{PopsicleTruss} Popsicle sticks and \\param{GlueTruss} units of glue. Each team has at most \\param{TotalPopsicles} Popsicle sticks and \\param{TotalGlue} units of glue. In addition, each team can build at most \\param{MaxTruss} truss bridges and the number of beam bridges must be larger than the number of truss bridges. If a beam bridge can hold \\param{MassBeam} grams and a truss bridge can hold \\param{MassTruss} grams, how many of each bridge should a team build to maximize the total mass that can be supported?"
