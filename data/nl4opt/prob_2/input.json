    "description": "An accounting firm has senior accountants earning \\param{WageSenior} per week and junior accountants earning \\param{WageJunior} per week. The contracts with companies to provide accounting services require at least \\param{MinAccountants} accountants, of whom at least \\param{MinSenior} must be senior accountants. To make sure there is enough experience on the accounting team, the number of senior accountants should be at least \\param{RatioSeniorJunior} of the number of junior accountants. The firm wants to keep the weekly wage bill below \\param{MaxWageBill}. Formulate an LP to minimize the wage bill."
