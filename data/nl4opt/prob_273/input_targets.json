A camel caravan can deliver \\param{UnitsCamel} units of goods per trip and takes \\param{TimeCamel} hours. A desert truck can deliver \\param{UnitsTruck} units of goods per trip and takes \\param{TimeTruck} hours. However, due to the cost of fuel, the company prefers to have more camel caravans than desert trucks. If the company needs to deliver \\param{GoodsTotal} units of goods, how many of each method of transportation should the company organize to minimize the total number of hours required?",
