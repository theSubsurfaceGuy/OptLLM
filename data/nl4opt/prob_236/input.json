    "description": "A food delivery person can either have shifts on bikes or scooters. A shift on a bike can deliver \\param{OrdersBike} orders, takes \\param{EnergyBike} units of energy, and brings in \\param{TipsBike} on tips because it is faster. A shift on a scooter can deliver \\param{OrdersScooter} orders, takes \\param{EnergyScooter} units of energy, and brings in \\param{TipsScooter} on tips. The delivery person has available \\param{TotalShifts} shifts a month and has \\param{TotalEnergy} units of energy and must bring at least \\param{MinOrders} orders. He must have at least \\param{MinScooterShifts} shifts on a scooter because bikes are harder to get. How many shifts on each type of transportation should the delivery person schedule to maximize tips received?"
