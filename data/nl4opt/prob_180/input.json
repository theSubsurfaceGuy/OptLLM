    "description": "A water salesman collects water from a glacier and transports it in either small or large kegs. A small keg can hold \\param{SmallKegCapacity} liters of water while a large keg can hold \\param{LargeKegCapacity} liters of water. The salesman has available at most \\param{MaxSmallKegs} small kegs and \\param{MaxLargeKegs} large kegs. Since small kegs are easier to carry, at least \\param{MinSmallLargeRatio} times as many small kegs must be used than large kegs. If he can transport at most \\param{MaxKegsTransport} kegs total and at least \\param{MinLargeKegs} kegs must be large, how many of each should he use to maximize the total amount of glacial water he can transport?"
