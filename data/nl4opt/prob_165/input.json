A bike can hold \\param{BikeCapacity} meals and requires \\param{BikeCharge} units of charge. A scooter can hold \\param{ScooterCapacity} meals and requires \\param{ScooterCharge} units of charge. Since the city is more friendly towards scooters, at most \\param{MaxBikeRatio} of the electric vehicles can be bikes and at least \\param{MinScooters} scooters must be used. If the company only has \\param{TotalCharge} units of charge available, how many of each vehicle should be used to maximize the number of meals that can be delivered?"
