    "description": "A bakery uses a stand-mixer and a slow bake oven to make bread and cookies. Each machine can run for at most \\param{MaxHours} hours per year. To bake a loaf of bread takes \\param{BreadMixerHours} hour in the stand mixer and \\param{BreadOvenHours} hours in the oven. A batch of cookies requires \\param{CookieMixerHours} hours in the mixer and \\param{CookieOvenHours} hour in the oven. The profit per loaf of bread is \\param{ProfitBread} and the profit per batch of cookies is \\param{ProfitCookies}. How should the bakery operate to maximize total profit?"
