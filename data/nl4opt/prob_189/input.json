    "description": "A chemical company is transporting their hydrogen using two different methods, high pressure tube trailers and liquefied hydrogen tankers. The first method is a high-pressure tube trailer which can transport \\param{TubeCapacity} cubic meters each per trip at a cost of \\param{TubeCost}. The second method is using liquefied hydrogen tankers which can transport \\param{TankerCapacity} cubic meters each per trip at a cost of \\param{TankerCost}. The company needs to transport at least \\param{MinVolume} cubic meters of hydrogen and they have a budget of \\param{Budget} available. In addition, the number of transports done by the high pressure tube trailer method has to be less than the number of transports done by the liquefied hydrogen tanker method. How many of each transportation method should they use to minimize the total number of trips?"
