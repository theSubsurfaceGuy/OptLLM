    "description": "A bakery makes almond and pistachio croissants. An almond croissant requires \\param{ButterA} units of butter and \\param{FlourA} units of flour. A pistachio croissant requires \\param{ButterP} units of butter and \\param{FlourP} units of flour. The bakery has available \\param{TotalButter} units of butter and \\param{TotalFlour} units of flour. Since the almond croissant is more popular, at least \\param{AlmondPistachioRatio} times as many almond croissants should be made as pistachio croissants. If making an almond croissant takes \\param{TimeA} minutes and making a pistachio croissant takes \\param{TimeP} minutes, how many of each should be made to minimize the total production time?"
