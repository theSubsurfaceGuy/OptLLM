    "description": "A lawn mowing service provides neighborhood services using small teams and large teams. A small team requires \\param{SmallTeamEmployees} employees and can mow \\param{SmallTeamArea} sq ft of lawn. A large team requires \\param{LargeTeamEmployees} employees and can mow \\param{LargeTeamArea} sq ft of lawn. The company has \\param{TotalEmployees} employees available. Because most people have smaller lawns in the city, the number of small teams must be at least \\param{MinRatioSmallToLarge} times as much as the number of large teams. In addition, to make sure the company can meet all demands, there has to be at least \\param{MinLargeTeams} large teams and at least \\param{MinSmallTeams} small teams. How many of each team type should be used to maximize the amount of lawn that can be mowed?"
