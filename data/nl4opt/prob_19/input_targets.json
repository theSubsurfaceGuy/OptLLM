Each thin jar requires \\var{ThinShapingTime} minutes of shaping time and \\var{ThinBakingTime} minutes of baking time. Each stubby jar requires \\var{StubbyShapingTime} minutes of shaping time and \\var{StubbyBakingTime} minutes of baking time. Per week, there are \\var{TotalShapingTime} minutes available for shaping and \\var{TotalBakingTime} minutes available for baking. The profit per thin jar is \\var{ProfitThin} and the profit per stubby jar is \\var{ProfitStubby}. How many jars of each type should the artisan make to maximize profit?",
