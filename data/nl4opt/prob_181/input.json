    "description": "A tropical city full of islands sends mail either by submarine or by boat. A submarine can carry \\param{SubmarineCapacity} pieces of mail per trip and uses \\param{SubmarineFuel} liters of gas. A boat can carry \\param{BoatCapacity} pieces of mail per trip and uses \\param{BoatFuel} liters of gas. There can be at most \\param{MaxSubmarineTrips} submarine trips and a minimum of \\param{MinBoatTripProportion} of the trips must be by boat. If the city needs to transport at least \\param{MinMail} pieces of mail, how many of each transportation should they use to minimize the total amount of gas used?"
