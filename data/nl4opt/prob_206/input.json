    "description": "A toy store sells plush toys and dolls. Each plush toy costs the store \\param{CostPlush} and each doll costs the store \\param{CostDoll}. The store owner can spend at most \\param{MaxInventory} on inventory. Each plush toy is then sold for a profit of \\param{ProfitPlush} while each doll is sold for a profit of \\param{ProfitDoll}. The owner estimates that at least \\param{MinPlushSold} plush toys but at most \\param{MaxPlushSold} plush toys are sold each month. He also estimates that the number of dolls sold is at most \\param{MaxDollsToPlushRatio} times the amount of plush toys sold. How many of each should be bought and sold to maximize profit?"
