    "description": "A gem factory has two drills, a high intensity one and a low intensity one. Each day, the high intensity drill can process \\param{CapHigh} gems and requires \\param{WaterHigh} units of water to dissipate heat. Each day, the low intensity drill can process \\param{CapLow} gems and requires \\param{WaterLow} units of water to dissipate heat. Each day the factory must process \\param{TotalGems} gems and they have available \\param{TotalWater} units of water. Since the high intensity drill produces a lot of noise pollution, at most \\param{MaxPercentHigh} of the drills can be high intensity ones. Further, at least \\param{MinLowDrills} should be low intensity drills. How many of each drill should be used to minimize the total number of drills needed?"
