    "description": "A bee farmer transports his honey in small and large bottles. A small bottle can take \\param{SmallBottleCapacity} units of honey while a large bottle can take \\param{LargeBottleCapacity} units of honey. The farmer has available at most \\param{MaxSmallBottles} small bottles and at most \\param{MaxLargeBottles} large bottles. In addition, since small bottles are easier to sell, at least \\param{MinRatioSmallToLarge} times as many small bottles must be used than large bottles. Finally, he can transport at most \\param{MaxBottlesTransported} bottles total, and at least \\param{MinLargeBottles} must be large bottles. How many of each bottle should he use to maximize the total amount of honey he can transport?"
