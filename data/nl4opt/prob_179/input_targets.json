Each cargo plane can transport \\param{TiresPlane} tires per trip and costs \\param{CostPlane}. Each ultrawide truck can transport \\param{TiresTruck} tires per trip and costs \\param{CostTruck}. The company needs to transport at least \\param{MinTires} tires and has available \\param{Budget}. Because most remote sites don't have proper airports, the number of plane trips cannot exceed the number of ultrawide truck trips.
