    "description": "Mr. Roberts wants to invest in the telecom and healthcare industries. He has \\param{TotalInvestment} to invest. He has decided that the amount invested in telecom be at least \\param{MinTelecomRatio} times as much as the amount invested in healthcare. But the money invested in telecom must be at most \\param{MaxTelecomInvestment}. If investments in telecom earn \\param{ProfitTelecom} and investments in healthcare earn \\param{ProfitHealthcare}, how much should Mr. Roberts invest in each to maximize profit?"
