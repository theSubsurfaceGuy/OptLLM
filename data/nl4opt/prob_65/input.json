    "description": "An oil and gas company operates on \\param{TotalLand} acres of land where they use oil wells of small and large size. Per acre of land, a small oil well can produce \\param{OilSmall} barrels of oil. Per acre of land, a large oil well can produce \\param{OilLarge} barrels of oil. However, a small oil well produces \\param{PollSmall} units of pollution and requires \\param{DrillBitSmall} drill bits per acre and a large oil well produces \\param{PollLarge} units of pollution and requires \\param{DrillBitLarge} drill bits per acre. The company has available \\param{TotalDrillBits} drill bits and due to strict environmental laws can produce at most \\param{MaxPollution} units of pollution. For how many acres should each oil well be used to maximize the total production of oil?"
