    "description": "A car manufacturer ships their cars on large and small planes. A large plane can carry \\param{LargePlaneCapacity} cars while a small plane can carry \\param{SmallPlaneCapacity} cars. Since large planes cause more pollution, the number of large planes must be less than \\param{PollutionRatio} times the number of small planes. If the manufacturer wants to deliver at least \\param{MinimumCarsDelivered} cars, find the minimum number of planes that can be used."
