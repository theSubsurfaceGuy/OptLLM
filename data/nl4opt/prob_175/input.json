A seasonal volunteer can deliver \\param{GiftsPerSeasonal} gifts and gets \\param{SeasonalPoints} points. A full-time volunteer can deliver \\param{GiftsPerFullTime} gifts and gets \\param{FullTimePoints} points. The store can only give out \\param{MaxPoints} points. In addition, a maximum of \\param{MaxSeasonalPercent} of the volunteers can be seasonal and at least \\param{MinFullTimeVolunteers} must be full-time. How many of each volunteer is needed to maximize the total number of gifts that can be delivered?"
