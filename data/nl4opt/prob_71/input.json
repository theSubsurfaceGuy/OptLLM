    "description": "A laundromat can buy two types of washing machines, a top-loading model and a front-loading model. The top-loading model can wash \\param{CapacityTop} items per day while the front-loading model can wash \\param{CapacityFront} items per day. The top-loading model consumes \\param{EnergyTop} kWh per day while the front-loading model consumes \\param{EnergyFront} kWh per day. The laundromat must be able to wash at least \\param{MinCapacity} items per day and has available \\param{TotalEnergy} kWh per day. Since the top-loading machines are harder to use, at most \\param{MaxTopProp} of the machines can be top-loading. Further, at least \\param{MinFront} machines should be front-loading. How many of each machine should the laundromat buy to minimize the total number of washing machines?"
