    "description": "Each month a store owner can spend at most \\param{Budget} on carrots and cucumbers. A carrot costs the store owner \\param{CostCarrot} and a cucumber costs the store owner \\param{CostCucumber}. Each carrot is sold for a profit of \\param{ProfitCarrot} and each cucumber is sold for a profit of \\param{ProfitCucumber}. The owner estimates that the number of cucumbers sold is at most \\param{RatioCucumbersToCarrots} of the number of carrots sold. He also estimates that at least \\param{MinCarrotsSold} carrots but at most \\param{MaxCarrotsSold} carrots are sold each month. How many of each, carrots and cucumbers, should be sold in order to maximize the profit?"
