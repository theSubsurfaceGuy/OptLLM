    "description": "A food company would like to run its commercials on three streaming platforms: Pi TV, Beta Video and Gamma Live. The cost for a commercial as well as the expected audience reach is given. On Pi TV, a commercial costs \\param{CostPiTV} and attracts \\param{ReachPiTV} viewers. On Beta Video, a commercial costs \\param{CostBetaVideo} and attracts \\param{ReachBetaVideo} viewers. On Gamma Live, a commercial costs \\param{CostGammaLive} and attracts \\param{ReachGammaLive} viewers. Beta Video limits the number of commercials from a single company to \\param{MaxCommercialsBetaVideo}. In order to attract a wide range of people, at most \\param{MaxPropGammaLive} of all commercials should occur on Gamma Live and a minimum of \\param{MinPropPiTV} should occur on Pi TV. If the weekly budget is \\param{WeeklyBudget}, how many commercials should be run in each of the three possible choices in order to maximize audience?"
