    "description": "A pharmaceutical company has two labs, Lab 1 and Lab 2, where they make heart and lung medication pills. At Lab 1, they can produce \\param{HeartLab1} heart medication pills and \\param{LungLab1} lung medication pills per hour. At Lab 2, they can produce \\param{HeartLab2} heart medication pills and \\param{LungLab2} lung medication pills per hour. Each session at Lab 1 requires \\param{WorkerLab1} hours of worker labor, while each session at Lab 2 requires \\param{WorkerLab2} hours of worker labor. The company has \\param{TotalWorkerHours} worker hours available and must make at least \\param{MinHeartPills} heart medication pills and at least \\param{MinLungPills} lung medication pills. How many hours at each lab should be run to minimize the total time needed?"
