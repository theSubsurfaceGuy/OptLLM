    "description": "A hospital hires ultrasound technicians and graduate researchers to image patients. An ultrasound technician works \\param{TechnicianHoursPerShift} hours per shift while a graduate researcher works \\param{ResearcherHoursPerShift} hours per shift. Ultrasound technicians are paid \\param{TechnicianPaymentPerShift} per shift while graduate researchers are paid \\param{ResearcherPaymentPerShift} per shift. However, due to regulations, there must be \\param{RequiredTechnicianToResearcherRatio} times as many ultrasound technician shifts than graduate researcher shifts. Currently, the hospital needs \\param{TotalUltrasoundHoursNeeded} hours of ultrasound services to meet needs. If the hospital has a budget of \\param{TotalBudget}, how many of each worker certified to use the ultrasound should be scheduled to reduce the total number of workers?"
