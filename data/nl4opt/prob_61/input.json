    "description": "A high rise building is buying two types of furnaces, a new model and an old model. A new model furnace can heat \\param{HeatNew} apartments and consumes \\param{EnergyNew} kWh per day. An old model can heat \\param{HeatOld} apartments and consumes \\param{EnergyOld} kWh per day. Since the old model is harder to find, at most \\param{MaxOldProp} of the furnaces can be the old model and at least \\param{MinNew} new model furnaces should be used. If the high rise needs to heat at least \\param{MinApartments} apartments and has \\param{MaxEnergy} kWh of electricity available, how many of each furnace should be purchased to minimize the total number of furnaces?"
