    "description": "A chicken farmer has sold his chicken and they need to be transported either by bus or by car. A bus can take \\param{BusCapacity} chicken and takes \\param{BusTripTime} hours per trip. A car can take \\param{CarCapacity} chicken and takes \\param{CarTripTime} hours per trip. There can be at most \\param{MaxBusTrips} bus trips and at least \\param{MinimumCarTripPercentage} of the trips must be by car. If the farmer needs to transport \\param{TotalChicken} chicken, how many trips of each should be done to minimize the total time needed to transport the chicken?"
