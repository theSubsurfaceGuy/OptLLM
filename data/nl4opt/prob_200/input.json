    "description": "A meat processing plant uses two machines, a meat slicer and a meat packer, to make their hams and pork ribs. To produce one batch of hams requires \\param{HamSlicerHours} hours on the meat slicer and \\param{HamPackerHours} hours on the meat packer. To produce one batch of pork ribs requires \\param{RibSlicerHours} hours on the meat slicer and \\param{RibPackerHours} hours on the meat packer. Each machine runs for at most \\param{MaxHours} hours per year. If the profit per batch of hams is \\param{HamProfit} and the profit per batch of pork ribs is \\param{RibProfit}, how many batches of each should be made to maximize profit?"
