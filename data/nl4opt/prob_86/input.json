    "description": "A coffee shop sells mochas and regular coffees. Each mocha requires \\param{CoffeePowderPerMocha} units of coffee powder and \\param{MilkPerMocha} units of milk. Each regular coffee requires \\param{CoffeePowderPerRegular} units of coffee powder and \\param{MilkPerRegular} units of milk. The shop has available \\param{TotalCoffeePowder} units of coffee powder and \\param{TotalMilk} units of milk. Making a mocha takes \\param{TimePerMocha} minutes and making a regular coffee takes \\param{TimePerRegular} minutes. Since mochas are more popular among people, the shop must make at least \\param{MochaToRegularRatio} times as many mochas as regular coffees. How many of each should they make to minimize the total production time?"
