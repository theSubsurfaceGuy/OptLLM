    "description": "A jam company sends its product out in small and large jars. A \\param{SmallJarVolume} ml small jar can hold while a \\param{LargeJarVolume} ml large jar can hold. Most stores prefer the smaller size, and so the number of large jars cannot exceed the number of small jars. If the company wants to ship at least \\param{MinimumVolume} ml of jam, find the minimum number of jars that can be used."
