    "description": "A landscaper has \\param{A} square feet of grass land in a customer\u2019s backyard where they need to cut grass using either a heavy-duty yard machine or a gas lawn mower. For each square foot of land, the heavy-duty yard machine requires \\param{TimeHeavyDuty} seconds while the gas lawn mower takes \\param{TimeGasMower} seconds. Per square foot, the heavy-duty yard machine produces \\param{PollutionHeavyDuty} units of pollution and requires \\param{FuelHeavyDuty} units of fuel. Conversely, the gas lawn mower generates \\param{PollutionGasMower} units of pollution for each square foot and requires \\param{FuelGasMower} units of fuel. There are \\param{FuelTotal} units of fuel available and the landscaper can produce no more than \\param{PollutionMax} units of pollution. For how many square feet should each machine be used to minimize the time required to cut this customer\u2019s backyard?",
