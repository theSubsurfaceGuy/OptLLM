    "description": "A clinic is conducting throat or nasal swabs on each patient. A throat swab takes \\param{ThroatSwabTime} minutes while a nasal swab takes \\param{NasalSwabTime} minutes. The clinic must administer at least \\param{MinNasalSwabs} nasal swabs. Since the nasal swab is more uncomfortable, at least \\param{ThroatNasalRatio} times as many throat swabs must be done as nasal swabs. If the clinic is only operational for \\param{TotalTime} minutes, how many of each swab should be done to maximize the number of patients seen?"
