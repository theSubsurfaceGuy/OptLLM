    "description": "A bodybuilder buys pre-prepared meals, a turkey dinner, and a tuna salad sandwich. The turkey dinner contains \\param{ProteinTurkeyDinner} grams of protein, \\param{CarbsTurkeyDinner} grams of carbs, and \\param{FatTurkeyDinner} grams of fat. The tuna salad sandwich contains \\param{ProteinTunaSalad} grams of protein, \\param{CarbsTunaSalad} grams of carbs, and \\param{FatTunaSalad} grams of fat. The bodybuilder wants to get at least \\param{MinProtein} grams of protein and \\param{MinCarbs} grams of carbs. In addition, because the turkey dinner is expensive, at most \\param{MaxTurkeyDinnerProportion} of the meals should be turkey dinners. How many of each meal should he eat if he wants to minimize his fat intake?"
