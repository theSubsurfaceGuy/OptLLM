    "background": "A factory operates two types of machines, A and B, to produce items. Both machines have different production rates and energy consumptions. The factory must meet minimum production requirements, adhere to electricity limitations, maintain a certain percentage of machine type B, and ensure a minimum number of machine A are used.",
    "constraints": [
        "Number of items made by machine A and B together is at least MinItems per day",
        "Total electricity consumption by machines A and B is at most MaxElectricity kWh per day",
        "Number of machine B is at most MaxPercentB percent of the total number of machines",

    "description": "A factory has two machines, A and B. Each day, machine A can make \\param{ItemsAMadePerDay} items and consumes \\param{ElectricityA} kWh. Machine B can make \\param{ItemsBMadePerDay} items and consumes \\param{ElectricityB} kWh per day. The factory must produce at least \\param{MinItems} items per day and has \\param{MaxElectricity} kWh of electricity available per day. Since there are not many workers that can operate both machines, at most \\param{MaxPercentB} of the machines must be of type B. Further, at least \\param{MinMachineA} machines of type A should be used. How many of each machine should be used to minimize the total number of machines?",
