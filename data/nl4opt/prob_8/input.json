He has decided that the money invested in his favorite clothing company must be at least \\param{InvestmentRatio} times as much as the amount invested in his favorite tech company. He has also limited himself to invest at most \\param{MaxTechInvestment} in his favorite tech company. If the money invested in his favorite clothing company earns \\param{ReturnRateClothing} and the money invested in his favorite tech company earns \\param{ReturnRateTech}, how much should he invest in each to maximize his profit?"
