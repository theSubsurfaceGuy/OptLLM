A minibus can take \\param{MinibusCapacity} kids and produces \\param{MinibusPollution} units of pollution. There are at least \\param{MinKids} kids that need to go to school and at most \\param{MaxMinibuses} minibuses can be used. In addition, the number of vans used must exceed the number of minibuses. How many of each should be used to minimize the total amount of pollution produced?"
