    "description": "Due to an accident, at least \\param{MinLocals} locals must be moved across a lake. They can either be transported over the lake by a kayak or a motorboat. Kayaks can transport \\param{PeoplePerKayak} people every trip and motorboats can transport \\param{PeoplePerMotorboat} people every trip. Kayaks take \\param{TimePerKayak} minutes per trip whereas motorboats take \\param{TimePerMotorboat} minutes per trip. Due to the limited number of motorboats available to the locals, there can be at most \\param{MaxMotorboatTrips} motorboat trips and at least \\param{MinPercentKayakTrips}% of the trips should be by kayak. How many of each transportation method should be used to minimize the total amount of time needed to transport all the locals?"
