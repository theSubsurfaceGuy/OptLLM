    "description": "A milk tea shop owner would like to sell two different milk teas: black milk tea and matcha milk tea. Each contains both milk and honey. A bottle of black milk tea contains \\param{BlackMilk} grams of milk and \\param{BlackHoney} grams of honey, whereas a bottle of matcha milk tea contains \\param{MatchaMilk} grams of milk and \\param{MatchaHoney} grams of honey. The profit from each bottle of black milk tea sold is \\param{ProfitBlack} and the profit from each bottle of matcha milk tea sold is \\param{ProfitMatcha}. If his total production must not exceed his available stock of \\param{TotalMilk} grams of milk and \\param{TotalHoney} grams of honey, how many bottles of each type of milk tea should be made to maximize profits?"
