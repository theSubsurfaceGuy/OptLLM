    "description": "An autobody shop needs to purchase two types of car jacks, an automatic electric one, or a gas-powered one. The automatic electric one can process \\param{CarsPerHourElectric} cars every hour and uses \\param{ElectricityPerJack} units of electricity whereas the gas-powered one can process \\param{CarsPerHourGas} cars each hour using \\param{GasPerJack} units of gas. Since there is a limit to how many automatic electric ones there can be due to the limited number of power outlets, the shop must use less than \\param{MaxElectricJacks} automatic electric ones. The shop can use at most \\param{MaxElectricity} units of electricity and \\param{MaxGas} units of gas. How many of each type of jack should the shop purchase to maximize the amount of cars processed every hour?"
