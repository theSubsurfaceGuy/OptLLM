    "description": "Mrs. Watson wants to invest in the real-estate market and has a total budget of at most \\param{TotalBudget}. She has two choices which include condos and detached houses. Each dollar invested in condos yields a \\param{ProfitCondo} profit and each dollar invested in detached houses yields a \\param{ProfitHouse} profit. A minimum of \\param{MinPercentCondo} of all money invested must be in condos, and at least \\param{MinInvestHouse} must be in detached houses. Formulate an LP that can be used to maximize total profit earned from Mrs. Watson's investment."
