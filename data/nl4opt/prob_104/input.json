    "description": "A scientist in the arctic needs to get enough vitamin D and vitamin C in his diet by drinking orange and apple juice. Each box of orange juice contains \\param{VitaminDOrange} units of vitamin D and \\param{VitaminCOrange} units of vitamin C. Each box of apple juice contains \\param{VitaminDApple} units of vitamin D and \\param{VitaminCApple} units of vitamin C. Since the scientist prefers apple juice, he must drink at least \\param{MinRatioAppleToOrange} times as many apple juice boxes as orange juice boxes. However, he must also drink at least \\param{MinOrange} orange juice boxes. To avoid a vitamin C overdose, the scientist can consume at most \\param{MaxVitaminC} units of vitamin C. How many of each juice box should he drink to maximize his total vitamin D intake?"
