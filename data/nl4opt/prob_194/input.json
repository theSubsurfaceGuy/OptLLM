    "description": "A snow removal company removes snow from neighborhoods using small trucks and large trucks. A small truck requires \\param{PeopleSmallTruck} people to shovel the snow and can carry \\param{CapacitySmallTruck} units of snow. A large truck requires \\param{PeopleLargeTruck} people to shovel the snow and can carry \\param{CapacityLargeTruck} units of snow. The company has available \\param{TotalPeople} people. In addition, because some neighborhoods don\u2019t allow big trucks, at least \\param{MinSmallTrucks} trucks must be small. There must be at least \\param{MinLargeTrucks} large trucks as well, and the number of small trucks must be \\param{TruckProportion} times the number of large trucks. How many of each truck should be used to maximize the total amount of snow that can be transported?"
