    "description": "There has been a horrible accident and patients need to be taken to the hospital by either a helicopter or bus. A helicopter can transport \\param{HelicopterCapacity} patients per trip and takes \\param{HelicopterTripTime} hour. On the other hand, a bus can transport \\param{BusCapacity} patients per trip and takes \\param{BusTripTime} hours. At least \\param{MinPatients} patients need to be transported and at least \\param{MinHelicopterTripsPercentage} of the trips should be by helicopter. In addition, there can be at most \\param{MaxBusTrips} bus trips. How should the patients be taken to minimize the total time to transport the patients?"
