    "description": "A car manufacturer makes two versions of the same car, a regular model and a premium model. They make x1 regular models per day and x2 premium models per day. The profit per regular model is \\param{ProfitRegular} and the profit per premium model is \\param{ProfitPremium} (x1 and x2 are unknown values both greater than or equal to 0). The daily demand for these cars is limited to at most \\param{MaxDemandRegular} regular models and \\param{MaxDemandPremium} premium models. In addition, the manufacturer can make a maximum of \\param{MaxTotal} cars of either type per day. How many cars of each model should the manufacturer make in order to maximize profit?"
