    "description": "A breakfast joint makes two different sandwiches: a regular and a special. Both need eggs and bacon. Each regular sandwich requires \\param{EggsReg} eggs and \\param{BaconReg} slices of bacon. Each special sandwich requires \\param{EggsSpec} eggs and \\param{BaconSpec} slices of bacon. The joint has a total of \\param{TotalEggs} eggs and \\param{TotalBacon} slices of bacon. It makes a profit of \\param{ProfitReg} per regular sandwich and a profit of \\param{ProfitSpec} per special sandwich. How many of each sandwich should be made to maximize profit?"
