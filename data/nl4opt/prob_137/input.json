    "description": "A doctor suggests that his patient eat oranges and grapefruit to meet his vitamin \\param{MinVitaminC} and \\param{MinVitaminA} requirements. One orange contains \\param{VitaminCOrange} units of vitamin C, \\param{VitaminAOrange} units of vitamin A, and \\param{SugarOrange} grams of sugar. One grapefruit contains \\param{VitaminCGrapefruit} units of vitamin C, \\param{VitaminAGrapefruit} units of vitamin A, and \\param{SugarGrapefruit} grams of sugar. The patient must get at least \\param{MinVitaminC} units of vitamin C and \\param{MinVitaminA} units of vitamin A. Since the patient prefers oranges, he must eat at least \\param{OrangeGrapefruitRatio} times as many oranges as grapefruits. How many of each should he eat to minimize his sugar intake?"
