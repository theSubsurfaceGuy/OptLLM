    "description": "A banana company sells their bananas in small and large crates. A small crate can hold \\param{BananasPerSmallCrate} bananas while a large crate can hold \\param{BananasPerLargeCrate} bananas. Since large crates are more manageable, the number of large crates must be at least \\param{MinLargeToSmallRatio} times the number of small crates. However, at least \\param{MinSmallCrates} small crates should be used. If the company has available \\param{TotalBananas} bananas, how many of each crate should the company use to maximize the total number of crates produced?"
