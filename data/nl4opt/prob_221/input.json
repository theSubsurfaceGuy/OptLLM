    "description": "Platinum Database sells two types of subscription software packages: a personal license and a commercial license which will cost \\param{PersonalLicenseCost} and \\param{CommercialLicenseCost} to generate respectively. The marketing department estimates that they can sell at most \\param{MaxLicenses} licenses for both versions combined a month. The profit per personal license is \\param{PersonalLicenseProfit} and the profit per commercial version is \\param{CommercialLicenseProfit}. If the company does not want to spend more than \\param{TotalCostLimit}, how many of each software package should they produce to maximize the profits."
