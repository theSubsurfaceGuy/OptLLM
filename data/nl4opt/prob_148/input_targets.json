The pill vaccine takes \\param{PillTime} minutes to administer while the shot takes \\param{ShotTime} minutes to administer. Since the shot has been more thoroughly studied, the clinic must deliver at least \\param{RatioShotsToPills} times as many shots as pills. In addition, the clinic must administer at least \\param{MinPills} pill vaccines. If the clinic only operates for \\param{TotalTime} minutes, maximize the number of patients that can be vaccinated.",
