    "description": "An oil and gas company is sending their oil to the port using containers and trucks. A container can hold \\param{ContainerCapacity} units of oil while a truck can hold \\param{TruckCapacity} units of oil. Due to government restrictions, the number of trucks used has to at most \\param{TruckContainerRatio} times the number of containers used. If at least \\param{MinimumUnits} units of oil need to be sent to the port and at least \\param{MinimumContainers} containers need to be used, minimize the total number of containers and trucks needed."
