A car can take \\param{C} employees and produces \\param{Pc} units of pollution, while a bus can take \\param{B} employees and produces \\param{Pb} units of pollution. At least \\param{MinE} employees need to be transported and at most \\param{MaxBuses} buses can be used. How many of each type of transport should be taken to minimize the total pollution produced."
