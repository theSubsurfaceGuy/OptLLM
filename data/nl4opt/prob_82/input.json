    "description": "A hot dog company can build two types of butcher shops, a small shop and a large shop. A small shop can make \\param{HotDogsSmall} hot dogs per day and requires \\param{WorkersSmall} workers. A large shop can make \\param{HotDogsLarge} hot dogs per day and requires \\param{WorkersLarge} workers. The company must make at least \\param{MinHotDogs} hot dogs per day but they only have available \\param{TotalWorkers} workers. How many of each butcher shop should the company build to minimize the total number of butcher shops?"
