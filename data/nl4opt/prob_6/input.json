    "description": "A farmer has \\param{TotalArea} hectares available to grow tomatoes and potatoes. She prefers to plant more tomatoes than potatoes, but the soil and weather conditions allow her to grow at most twice the \\param{MaxRatioTomatoes} the amount of tomatoes to that of potatoes. In addition, she must grow at least \\param{MinTomatoes} hectares of tomatoes and at least \\param{MinPotatoes} hectares of potatoes to meet community demands. If the profit per hectare of tomatoes is $\\param{ProfitTomatoes} and the profit per hectare of potatoes is $\\param{ProfitPotatoes}, how many hectares of each crop should she plant to maximize profit? What is this profit?"
