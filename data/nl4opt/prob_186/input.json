    "description": "A construction company in the tropics uses cows and elephants to carry bricks. A cow can carry \\param{CapacityCow} bricks on its back while an elephant can carry \\param{CapacityElephant} bricks on its back. To avoid having elephants create too much traffic, the number of elephants cannot exceed the number of cows (\\param{MaxElephantsToCows}). In addition, there can be at most \\param{MaxCowElephantRatio} times the number of cows as elephants. If the company needs to transport at least \\param{MinBricks} bricks, find the minimum number of animals, cows and elephants, that can be used."
