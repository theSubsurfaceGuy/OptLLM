The process with a catalyst requires \\param{W_catalyst} units of wood and \\param{O_catalyst} units of oxygen to make \\param{CO2_catalyst} units of carbon dioxide. The process without a catalyst requires \\param{W_no_catalyst} units of wood and \\param{O_no_catalyst} units of oxygen to make \\param{CO2_no_catalyst} units of carbon dioxide. There are \\param{Wood_total} units of wood and \\param{Oxygen_total} units of oxygen available. How many of each process should be used to maximize the amount of carbon dioxide produced?",
