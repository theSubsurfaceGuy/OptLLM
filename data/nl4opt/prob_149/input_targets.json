    "background": "A chocolate company can transport boxes of chocolate using vans or trucks. Vans, which also serve as advertising, have a certain capacity and cost, differing from trucks. Both transport methods are constrained by capacity and cost, with a minimum transport requirement and a total budget. The company aims to minimize the total number of trips.",

        "Number of van trips is non-negative",

    "description": "A chocolate company can transport their boxes of chocolate either using their own vans or by renting trucks. Their vans can transport \\param{VanCapacity} boxes per trip while a truck can transport \\param{TruckCapacity} boxes per trip. Since they own their vans, the cost per van trip is \\param{VanCost} while the cost per truck trip is \\param{TruckCost}. The company needs to transport at least \\param{MinBoxes} boxes of chocolate and they have a budget of \\param{Budget}. Since the vans also provide advertising, the number of trips by van must be larger than the number of trips by trucks. How many of trip by each should be done to minimize the total number of trips?",
