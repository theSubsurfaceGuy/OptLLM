    "description": "In a science fair, there are two types of tables that can be used to display the children\u2019s science experiments. At the circular tables, \\param{PosterBoardsCircular} poster boards and \\param{ParticipantsCircular} participants can fit around the table to cater to \\param{GuestsCircular} guests. At the rectangular tables, \\param{PosterBoardsRectangular} poster boards and \\param{ParticipantsRectangular} participants can fit around the table to cater to \\param{GuestsRectangular} guests. However, each circular table takes up \\param{SpaceCircular} units of space while each rectangular table takes up \\param{SpaceRectangular} units of space. The science fair has must be able to fit at least \\param{MinParticipants} participants and \\param{MinPosterBoards} poster boards. If the science fair has available \\param{TotalSpace} units of space, how many of each type of table should be set up to maximize the number of catered guests?"
