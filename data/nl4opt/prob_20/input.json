    "description": "A grocery store wants to liquidate its stock of \\param{ApplesStock} apples, \\param{BananasStock} bananas, and \\param{GrapesStock} grapes. Given past experience, the store knows that they can propose a banana-haters package with \\param{ApplesBHPack} apples and \\param{GrapesBHPack} grapes and that this package will bring a profit of \\param{ProfitBHPack} euros. Similarly, they can prepare a combo package with \\param{ApplesCombo} apples, \\param{BananasCombo} bananas, and \\param{GrapesCombo} grapes, yielding a profit of \\param{ProfitCombo} euros. They know they can sell any quantity of these two packages within the availability of its stock. What quantity of each package, banana-haters packages and combo packages, should the store prepare to maximize net profit?"
