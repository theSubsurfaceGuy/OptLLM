    "description": "A production company needs to transport their equipment and staff for a movie they are shooting using large mobile production units or small mobile production units. Large mobile production units can hold \\param{LargeUnitCapacity} people and takes up \\param{LargeUnitSpots} parking spots whereas small mobile production units can hold only \\param{SmallUnitCapacity} people and takes up \\param{SmallUnitSpots} parking spot. Movie stars prefer to have their small mobile production unit to share with a close staff, therefore at least \\param{MinSmallUnits} units must be small mobile units. However, due to logistic limitations, since large mobile production units are more space efficient per spot, they must make up at least \\param{MinLargeUnitProportion} of all vehicles. If the movie needs to transport \\param{TotalPeople} people, minimize the total number of parking spots required by this production."
