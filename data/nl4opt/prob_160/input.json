A small bouquet has \\param{SmallBouquetSize} flowers while a large bouquet has \\param{LargeBouquetSize} flowers. The florist can transport at most \\param{MaxSmallBouquets} small bouquets and \\param{MaxLargeBouquets} large bouquets. In total, he can transport at most \\param{MaxTotalBouquets} bouquets and he must transport at least \\param{MinLargeBouquets} large bouquets. Since small bouquets are more popular, he must transport at least \\param{MinSmallLargeRatio} times as many small bouquets as large bouquets. How many of each bouquet should he transport to maximize the total number of flowers that reach the stores?"
