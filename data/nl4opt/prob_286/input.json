    "description": "A brewery can ferment their product into either wine or kombucha. Each unit of wine requires \\param{FruitWine} units of fruit and \\param{WaterWine} units of water. Each unit of kombucha requires \\param{FruitKombucha} units of fruit and \\param{TeaKombucha} units of tea. The company has available \\param{WaterAvailable} units of water and \\param{TeaAvailable} units of tea. Wine sells for more, therefore the number of wine must be larger than the number of kombucha. Additionally, at least \\param{MinKombuchaProp} of their products made must be kombucha. How many of each should the brewery make to minimize the total units of fruit required?"
