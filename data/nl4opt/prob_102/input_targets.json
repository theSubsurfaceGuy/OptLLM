    "description": "A summer camp does science experiments in two pre filled beakers, beaker 1 and beaker 2. Beaker 1 uses \\param{FlourBeaker1} units of flour and \\param{LiquidBeaker1} units of special liquid to make \\param{SlimeBeaker1} units of slime. Beaker 2 uses \\param{FlourBeaker2} units of flour and \\param{LiquidBeaker2} units of special liquid to make \\param{SlimeBeaker2} units of slime. However, beaker 1 creates \\param{WasteBeaker1} units of waste while beaker 2 creates \\param{WasteBeaker2} units of waste. The summer camp has \\param{TotalFlour} units of flour and \\param{TotalLiquid} units of special liquid available. If at most \\param{MaxWaste} units of waste can be produced, how many of each beaker should be used to maximize the amount of slime produced?",
