To meet demand, they must make at least \\param{MinMath} math workbooks and at least \\param{MinEnglish} English workbooks. However, they can make at most \\param{MaxMath} math workbooks and at most \\param{MaxEnglish} English workbooks. The company has a contract with a school to send at least \\param{MinTotalWorkbooks} workbooks of either type. If the profit per math workbook is $\\param{ProfitMath} and the profit per English workbook is $\\param{ProfitEnglish}, how many of each should the company make to maximize profit?"
