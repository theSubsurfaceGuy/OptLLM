A dolphin will do \\param{DolphinTricks} trick at a time and requires \\param{DolphinTreats} treats to do so. Since dolphins are more popular, at least \\param{MinDolphins} dolphins must be used and at most \\param{MaxOtterProportion} of the performers can be otters. If the aquarium only has \\param{TotalTreats} treats available, maximize the total number of tricks that can be performed."
