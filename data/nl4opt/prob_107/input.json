    "description": "A doctor recommends her patient eat more fish and chicken to increase her \\param{ProteinFish} and \\param{IronFish} intake. Each fish meal contains \\param{ProteinFish} units of protein and \\param{IronFish} units of iron. Each chicken meal contains \\param{ProteinChicken} units of protein and \\param{IronChicken} units of iron. The patient needs to consume at least \\param{MinProtein} units of protein and \\param{MinIron} units of iron. Since the chicken meal is less expensive, the patient prefers to consume at least \\param{MinChickenFishRatio} times as many chicken meals as fish meals. If each fish meal contains \\param{FatFish} units of fat and each chicken meal contains \\param{FatChicken} units of fat, how many meals of each should she eat to minimize her fat intake?"
