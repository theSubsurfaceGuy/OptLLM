    "description": "A handmade sports equipment manufacturing company makes basketballs and footballs. Basketballs require \\param{MaterialBasketball} units of materials and \\param{HourBasketball} hour to make whereas footballs require \\param{MaterialFootball} units of materials and \\param{HourFootball} hours to make. The manufacturing company has available \\param{TotalMaterial} units of materials and their workers working at max capacity can work for at most \\param{TotalHours} hours. Since basketballs sell better, there must be at least \\param{BasketballFootballRatio} times as many basketballs as footballs but the manufacturing company would like at least \\param{MinFootballs} footballs. How many of each should the manufacturing company make to maximize the total number of sports equipment produced?"
