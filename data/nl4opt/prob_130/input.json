    "description": "A patient in the hospital can take two different pain killers, pain killer 1 and pain killer 2. Per dose, pain killer 1 delivers \\param{LegMedicinePainKiller1} units of medicine to the legs and \\param{BackMedicinePainKiller1} units of medicine to the back. Per dose, pain killer 2 delivers \\param{LegMedicinePainKiller2} units of medicine to the legs and \\param{BackMedicinePainKiller2} units of medicine to the back. In addition, pain killer 1 delivers \\param{SleepMedicinePainKiller1} units of sleeping medicine and pain killer 2 delivers \\param{SleepMedicinePainKiller2} units of sleeping medicine. At most \\param{MaxSleepMedicine} units of sleep medicine should be delivered and at least \\param{MinLegMedicine} units of medicine should be delivered to the legs. How many doses of each should be taken to maximize the amount of medicine delivered to the back?"
