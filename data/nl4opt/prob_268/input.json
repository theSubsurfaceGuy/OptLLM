    "description": "A researcher must perform two types of experiments, in-vivo and ex-vivo. In-vivo experiments require \\param{TimeInVivoPrep} minutes to prepare and \\param{TimeInVivoExec} minutes to execute. Ex-vivo experiments require \\param{TimeExVivoPrep} minutes to prepare and \\param{TimeExVivoExec} minutes to execute. In addition, in-vivo experiments give the researcher \\param{RadiationInVivo} units of radiation while ex-vivo experiments give the researcher \\param{RadiationExVivo} units of radiation. At most \\param{MaxTimePrep} minutes can be used for preparation and \\param{MaxTimeExec} minutes for execution of the experiments. How many of each experiment should be scheduled by the researcher to minimize the total radiation received by the researcher?"
