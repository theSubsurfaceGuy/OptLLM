Long desks cost \\param{CostLongDesk}, take up \\param{AreaLongDesk} square feet of space, and seat \\param{SeatsLongDesk} employees. Short desks cost \\param{CostShortDesk}, take up \\param{AreaShortDesk} square feet of space, and seat \\param{SeatsShortDesk} employees. The office can have at most \\param{MaxArea} square feet of desks. How many of each desk should you buy in order to maximize the seating availability?"
