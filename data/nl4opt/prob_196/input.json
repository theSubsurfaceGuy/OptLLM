    "description": "An international shipping company uses large and small ships to transport containers around the world. A large ship can carry \\param{LargeShipCapacity} containers while a small ship can carry \\param{SmallShipCapacity} containers. Because most ports are small, the number of large ships cannot exceed the number of small ships. If the company is under contract needs to transport at least \\param{MinContainers} containers, find the minimum number of ships that can be used."
