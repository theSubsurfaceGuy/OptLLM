    "description": "An ice cream store can buy two machines, a counter-top sized one and a fridge sized one, to make ice cream. The counter-top sized one can produce \\param{ProdCountertop} cones worth of ice cream every day while the fridge sized one can produce \\param{ProdFridge} cones worth of ice cream every day. The counter-top sized machine outputs \\param{HeatCountertop} units of heat while the fridge sized one outputs \\param{HeatFridge} units of heat. The ice cream store can output at most \\param{MaxHeat} units of heat per day and must produce at least \\param{MinProd} cones worth of ice cream. How many of each machine should they buy to minimize the total number of machines needed?"
