    "description": "A navy ship is stocking food onto their submarine and their staff can eat either a salad or fruit bowl for their fibre and vitamin intake. The nutritionist in charge of this voyage needs to ensure that their staff gets at least \\param{V} units of vitamin and \\param{F} units of fibre each. Each salad contains \\param{VSalad} units of vitamins and \\param{FSalad} units of fibre. Each fruit bowl contains \\param{VFruitBowl} units of vitamin and \\param{FFruitBowl} units of fibre. In addition, since fruit bowls take longer to prepare, at most \\param{MaxFruitBowlProportion} of their meals should be fruit bowls. If each salad contains \\param{KSalad} units of potassium and each fruit bowl contains \\param{KFruitBowl} units of potassium, how many of each should they prepare for each staff to maximize their potassium intake?"
