A nurse works \\param{HoursNurse} hours per shift while a pharmacist works \\param{HoursPharmacist} hours per shift. Nurses are paid \\param{PayNurse} per shift while pharmacists are paid \\param{PayPharmacist} per shift. Currently, the clinic needs \\param{TotalHours} hours of healthcare labor to meet needs. If the firm has a budget of \\param{Budget}, how many of each healthcare worker should be scheduled to minimize the total number of workers?"
