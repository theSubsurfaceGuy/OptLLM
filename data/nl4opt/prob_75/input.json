    "description": "A tea estate has available \\param{TotalAcres} acres of land and they need to pick the tea leaves either using a traditional machine or modern machine. For each acre of land, the traditional machine can pick \\param{TradPickRate} kg of tea leaves, creates \\param{TradWasteRate} kg of waste, and requires \\param{TradFuelUse} liters of fuel. For each acre of land, the modern machine can pick \\param{ModPickRate} kg of tea leaves, creates \\param{ModWasteRate} kg of waste, and requires \\param{ModFuelUse} liters of fuel. The estate has available \\param{TotalFuel} liters of fuel and can handle at most \\param{MaxWaste} kg of waste. For how many acres should each machine be used to maximize the amount of tea leaves that can be picked?"
