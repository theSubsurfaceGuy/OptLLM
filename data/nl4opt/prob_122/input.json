    "description": "A science store makes two boxes, a cheap and expensive box. The cheap box contains \\param{MetalCheap} units of metal and \\param{AcidCheap} units of acid which can be mixed to create \\param{FoamCheap} units of foam. The expensive box contains \\param{MetalExpensive} units of metal and \\param{AcidExpensive} units of acid which can be mixed to create \\param{FoamExpensive} units of foam. The cheap box however gives off \\param{HeatCheap} units of heat while the expensive box gives off \\param{HeatExpensive} units of heat. The science store has available \\param{MetalTotal} units of metal and \\param{AcidTotal} units of acid. If at most \\param{HeatMax} units of heat can be given off, how many of each box should the store make to maximize the amount of foam produced?"
