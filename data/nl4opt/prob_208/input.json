One serving of health supplement A contains \\param{CaA} grams of Calcium and \\param{MgA} grams of Magnesium. One serving of health supplement B contains \\param{CaB} grams of Calcium and \\param{MgB} grams of Magnesium. The cost per health supplement for health supplement A is \\$\\param{CostA} and the cost per health supplement for health supplement B is \\$\\param{CostB}. A patient must consume these two health supplements every day to get at least \\param{MinCa} grams of Calcium and \\param{MinMg} grams of Magnesium. Determine how much servings of each supplement the patient needs to minimize her daily cost."
