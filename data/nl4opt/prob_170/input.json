    "description": "A snack exporter sends snacks to his customer in small and large suitcases. A small suitcase can hold \\param{SmallCapacity} snacks while a large suitcase can hold \\param{LargeCapacity} snacks. Most customer prefer small suitcases, and so at least \\param{RatioSmallToLarge} times as many small suitcases must be used as large suitcases. The exporter has available at most \\param{MaxSmallSuitcases} small suitcases and \\param{MaxLargeSuitcases} large suitcases. If he must send at least \\param{MinLargeSuitcases} large suitcases and can send at most \\param{MaxTotalSuitcases} suitcases in total, how many of each should he send to maximize the total number of snacks that can be delivered?"
