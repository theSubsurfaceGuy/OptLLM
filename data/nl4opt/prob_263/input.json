    "description": "A drop-in clinic is performing a test either through the ear or blood. A blood test takes \\param{BloodTestTime} minutes to perform while an ear test takes \\param{EarTestTime} minutes to perform. Since the blood test is more accurate, at least \\param{BloodEarRatio} times as many blood tests should be performed as ear tests. However, at least \\param{MinEarTests} ear tests must be administered. If the drop-in clinic operates for \\param{TotalTime} minutes, maximize the number of tests that can be performed."
