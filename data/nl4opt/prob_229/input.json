    "description": "A strata-management company is looking into purchasing two types of air conditioners, a low-power and a high-power model. A low-powered air conditioner can cool down \\param{LowPowerCapacity} housing units and uses \\param{LowPowerElectricity} units of electricity every day. A high-power model can cool down \\param{HighPowerCapacity} housing units and uses \\param{HighPowerElectricity} units of electricity every day. Since the low-powered model is not good for the aesthetics, the strata decided to limit the number of low-powered models to only \\param{MaxLowPowerProportion} and at least \\param{MinHighPower} high-powered models must be used. If the apartment needs to condition at least \\param{MinHousingUnits} housing units and has \\param{TotalElectricity} units of electricity available, how many of each air conditioner should the strata company buy to minimize the total number of air conditioners?"
