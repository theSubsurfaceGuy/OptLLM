    "description": "A berry farmer has two farms, an old and new farm, where he grows raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries. He has a contract to provide a local store with \\param{RaspberriesRequired} kg of raspberries, \\param{BlueberriesRequired} kg of blueberries, and \\param{StrawberriesRequired} kg of strawberries. At his old farm, it cost \\param{OldFarmCost} to operate per day and he can harvest and deliver \\param{OldFarmRaspberries} kg of raspberries, \\param{OldFarmBlueberries} kg of blueberries, and \\param{OldFarmStrawberries} kg of strawberries in a day. At his new farm, it costs \\param{NewFarmCost} to operate per day and he can harvest and deliver \\param{NewFarmRaspberries} kg of raspberries, \\param{NewFarmBlueberries} kg of blueberries, and \\param{NewFarmStrawberries} kg of strawberries in a day. Formulate a LP to meet his contract while minimizing his cost."
