    "description": "Ben is growing apples and pears on his orchard. He has \\param{TotalAcres} acres available on which he must grow a minimum of \\param{MinApples} acres of apples and a minimum of \\param{MinPears} acres of pears to meet demands. The profit per acre of apple is \\$\\param{ProfitApple} and the profit per acre of pear is \\$\\param{ProfitPear}. He prefers to grow more pears than apples but limitations in his workforce allow him to grow at most \\param{MaxPearsToApplesRatio} times the amount of pears as apples. How many of each fruit should Ben grow in order to maximize his profit? What is that profit?"
