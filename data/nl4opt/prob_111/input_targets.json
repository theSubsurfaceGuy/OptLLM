    "description": "A sailor can eat either crab cakes or lobster rolls for his meals. He needs to ensure he gets at least \\param{VitaminAmin} units of vitamin A and at least \\param{VitaminCmin} units of vitamin C. Each crab cake contains \\param{VitaminAcrab} units of vitamin A and \\param{VitaminCcrab} units of vitamin C. Each lobster roll contains \\param{VitaminAlobster} units of vitamin A and \\param{VitaminClobster} units of vitamin C. In addition, since lobster is more expensive, at most \\param{LobsterFractionMax} of his meals should be lobster rolls. If each crab cake contains \\param{FatCrab} units of unsaturated fat and each lobster roll contains \\param{FatLobster} units of unsaturated fat, how many of each should he eat to minimize his unsaturated fat intake?",
