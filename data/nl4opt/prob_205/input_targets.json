Assume that each serving of protein bars costs \\param{CostBars} and contains \\param{CaloriesBars} calories and \\param{ProteinBars} grams of protein. He's interested in spending as little money as possible but he wants to ensure that his meals have at least \\param{MinCalories} calories and at least \\param{MinProtein} grams of protein per day.
