    "description": "A popup clinic is doing virus testing with either spit tests or swabs. A spit test takes \\param{SpitTestTime} minutes to administer while a swab takes \\param{SwabTestTime} minutes to administer. Since the spit test is more accurate, at least \\param{SpitSwabRatio} times as many spit tests should be given as swabs. However, at least \\param{MinSwabs} swabs must be administered. If the popup clinic operates for \\param{TotalTime} minutes, maximize the number of tests that can be administered."
