Each painkiller pill requires \\param{MorphinePainkiller} mg of morphine and \\param{DigestiveMedicinePainkiller} units of digestive medicine. Each sleeping pill requires \\param{MorphineSleepingPill} mg of morphine and \\param{DigestiveMedicineSleepingPill} units of digestive medicine. The pharmacy needs to make at least \\param{MinPainkillers} painkiller pills. Since sleeping pills are more popular, at least \\param{MinProportionSleepingPills} of the pills should be sleeping pills. How many of each should the pharmacy make to minimize the total amount of digestive medicine needed?"
