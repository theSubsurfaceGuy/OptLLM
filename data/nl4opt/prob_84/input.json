    "description": "A scientist is conducting two experiments to produce electricity, experiment alpha and experiment beta. In experiment alpha, \\param{MetalAlpha} units of metal and \\param{AcidAlpha} units of acid are required to produce \\param{ElectricityAlpha} units of electricity. In experiment beta, \\param{MetalBeta} units of metal and \\param{AcidBeta} units of acid are required to produced \\param{ElectricityBeta} units of electricity. The lab has \\param{TotalMetal} units of metal and \\param{TotalAcid} units of acid available. How many of each experiment should the scientist conduct to maximize the total amount of electricity produced?"
