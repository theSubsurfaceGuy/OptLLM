The premium model can print \\param{PremiumSpeed} pages per minute while the regular model can print \\param{RegularSpeed} pages per minute. In addition, the premium model requires \\param{PremiumInkUse} units of ink per minute while the regular model requires \\param{RegularInkUse} units of ink per minute. The office wants to make sure that at least \\param{MinPages} pages can be printed per minute and that at most \\param{MaxInk} units of ink are used per minute. Since the premium model is more user friendly, the number of regular printers must be less than the number of premium printers.
