    "description": "Jordan is a chef. He wants to design a diet consisting of Kebabs and Rice. Assume that each serving of Rice costs \\param{CostRice} and contains \\param{CalRice} calories and \\param{ProtRice} grams of protein. Assume that each serving of Kebab costs \\param{CostKebab} and contains \\param{CalKebab} calories and \\param{ProtKebab} grams of protein. He's interested in spending as little money as possible but he wants to ensure that his meals have at least \\param{MinCal} calories and at least \\param{MinProt} grams of protein per day. Formulate a linear programming problem that will help minimize the cost of the diet."
