A scooter can carry \\param{ScooterCapacity} people while a rickshaw can carry \\param{RickshawCapacity} people. To avoid excessive pollution, at most \\param{MaxRickshawProportion} of the vehicles used can be rickshaws. If the park needs to transport at least \\param{MinVisitors} visitors, minimize the total number of scooters used."
