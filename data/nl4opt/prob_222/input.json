    "description": "Zeta Bakery sells two types of cookies. They sell a strawberry cookie and a sugar cookie. Let's say they make x1 strawberry cookies, at a profit of \\param{StrawberryProfit} each, and x2 sugar cookies, at a profit of \\param{SugarProfit} each (x1 and x2 are unknowns both greater than or equal to 0). The daily demand for these cookies is at most \\param{MaxStrawberryDemand} strawberry cookies and at most \\param{MaxSugarDemand} sugar cookies. The bakery is short staffed and can make a maximum of \\param{MaxProductionCapacity} cookies of either type per day. How much of each cookie should the bakery make in order to maximize profit?"
