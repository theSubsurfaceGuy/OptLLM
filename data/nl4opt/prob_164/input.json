    "description": "A sand company delivers sand for playgrounds in small and large containers. A small container requires \\param{SmallUnload} person to unload and can hold \\param{SmallCapacity} units of sand. A large container requires \\param{LargeUnload} people to unload and can hold \\param{LargeCapacity} units of sand. Since most playgrounds are small, the number of small containers used must be \\param{ContainerRatio} times the number of large containers used. In addition, there must be at least \\param{MinSmallContainers} small containers and \\param{MinLargeContainers} large containers used. If the company has \\param{PeopleAvailable} people available, maximize the amount of sand that they can deliver."
