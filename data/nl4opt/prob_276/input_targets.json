A cup of spinach contains \\param{FibreSpinach} units of fibre and \\param{IronSpinach} mg of iron.

Due to other nutritional requirements, the nurses decided that the number of cups of spinach must exceed the number of cups of soybeans. Furthermore, a cup of spinach contains \\param{CaloriesSpinach} calories while a cup of soybeans contains \\param{CaloriesSoybeans} calories.
