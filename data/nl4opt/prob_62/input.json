An urban factory can make \\param{ProdUrban} phones per day and requires \\param{MgrsUrban} managers. The company has available \\param{TotalMgrs} managers and must make at least \\param{MinPhones} phones per day. How many of each factory type should be built to minimize the total number of factories?"
