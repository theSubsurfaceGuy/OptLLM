    "description": "Both fertilizer and seeds need to be added to a lawn. One unit of fertilizer takes \\param{TimeFertilizer} minutes to be effective while one unit of seeds takes \\param{TimeSeeds} minutes to be effective. There can be at most \\param{MaxUnits} units of fertilizer and seeds combined added to the lawn. In addition at least \\param{MinFertilizer} units of fertilizer need to be added. Since the lawn is really patchy, there can be at most \\param{MaxFertilizerSeedRatio} times the amount of fertilizer as seeds. How many units of each should be added to minimize the total time it takes for the lawn to be ready?"
