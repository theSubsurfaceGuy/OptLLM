    "description": "A chemistry teacher teaches her students two experiments, experiment 1 and experiment 2. In experiment 1, \\param{Red1} units of the red liquid and \\param{Blue1} units of the blue liquid mix to create \\param{Green1} units of green gas. In experiment 2, \\param{Red2} units of the red liquid and \\param{Blue2} units of the blue liquid mix to create \\param{Green2} units of green gas. In addition, experiment 1 produces \\param{Smelly1} units of smelly gas while experiment 2 produces \\param{Smelly2} units of smelly gas. The lab has available \\param{TotalRed} units of red liquid and \\param{TotalBlue} units of blue liquid. If at most \\param{MaxSmelly} units of smelly gas can be produced, how many experiments of each should be done to maximize the total amount of green gas produced?"
