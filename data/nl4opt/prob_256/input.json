    "description": "A railway company is planning the infrastructure for the city and is considering two types of transportation, trains and trams. Each train can transport \\param{TrainCapacity} people per hour comfortably and each tram can transport \\param{TramCapacity} people per hour comfortably. Since trains take longer to build, the number of trams must be at least \\param{TramTrainRatio} times the number of trains. If the railway company wants to transport at least \\param{MinPeople} people per hour, minimize the total number of transportation units required."
