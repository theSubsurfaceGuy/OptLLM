A light grilled cheese sandwich requires \\param{BreadPerLight} slices of bread and \\param{CheesePerLight} slices of cheese. A heavy grilled cheese sandwich requires \\param{BreadPerHeavy} slices of bread and \\param{CheesePerHeavy} slices of cheese. Since most people who come to the store love grilled cheese, the store must make at least \\param{HeavyToLightRatio} times as many heavy grilled cheese sandwiches as light grilled cheese sandwiches. The store has available \\param{TotalBread} slices of bread and \\param{TotalCheese} slices of cheese. If a light grilled cheese sandwich takes \\param{TimeLight} minutes to make and a heavy grilled cheese sandwich takes \\param{TimeHeavy} minutes to make, how many of each should they make to minimize the total production time?",
