In demonstration 1, \\param{MintD1} units of mint and \\param{ActiveD1} units of the active ingredient is used to make \\param{FoamD1} units of minty foam. In demonstration 2, \\param{MintD2} units of mint and \\param{ActiveD2} units of the active ingredient is used to make \\param{FoamD2} units of minty foam. In addition, demonstration 1 creates \\param{TarD1} units of black tar while demonstration 2 creates \\param{TarD2} units of black tar. The show has available \\param{TotalMint} units of mint and \\param{TotalActive} units of active ingredients. If at most \\param{MaxTar} units of black tar can be produced, how many of each demonstration should be done to maximize the amount of minty foam produced?",
