    "description": "A audio company make two types of headphones: wired headphones and wireless headphones. Two different teams make each type of headphones. The wired team can make at most \\param{MaxWired} wired headphones per day and the wireless team can make at most \\param{MaxWireless} wireless headphones per day. Both teams require use of a shared audio testing machine, and this machine can be used to make a maximum of \\param{MaxTesting} headphones per day. The profit per wired headphone is \\param{ProfitWired} and the profit per wireless headphone \\param{ProfitWireless}. How many of each headphone should be made to maximize profit?"
