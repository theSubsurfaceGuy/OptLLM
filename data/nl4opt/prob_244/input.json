    "description": "A metal-working shop has access to two types of metal-working equipment, a chop saw and a steel cutter. A chop saw can work \\param{PoundsChopSaw} pounds of steel and generates \\param{WasteChopSaw} units of waste every day. A steel cutter can only cut \\param{PoundsSteelCutter} pounds of steel and generates \\param{WasteSteelCutter} units of waste every day. The metal-working shop is expecting an increase in demand and must cut \\param{TotalPounds} pounds of metal every day. However, there is a waste limitation due to the fines that may be in place if too much heavy metal is discarded and they may at most produce \\param{MaxWaste} units of waste every day. How should the metal-working shop purchase their metal-working equipment to decrease the total number of metal-working equipment needed?"
